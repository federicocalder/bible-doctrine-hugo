    <h2>David Lesson 002</h2>
    
    <p class="series-description">Continuation of the study of David&#39;s life, examining 1 Samuel 16:13 and the ministry of the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament versus the Church Age.</p>
    
    <p class="post-date">October 1, 2025</p>
    <h1 id="david-lesson-002">David Lesson 002</h1>
<p>The Word of God is alive and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit of the joints and the marrow, and is a critic of thoughts and intents of the heart.</p>
<p>All scripture is God-breathed and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God might be mature, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.</p>
<p>Study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</p>
<p>Open the Word of Truth this evening to 1 Samuel, chapter 16, 1 Samuel, chapter 16.</p>
<p>Secondly, people who allegedly come to Baraka Church wanted to know if there was anything going on tonight, and I told them, no, nothing new, and I do want to tell you something else.</p>
<p>Every now and then we get someone who hears we&rsquo;re having a conference here who is a Christian moocher. These kind of people will pray upon your sympathy and make you think that they&rsquo;re really in sad shape, and only you can help them.</p>
<p>If some panhandling, mooching Christian comes up to you and says, I&rsquo;m brother so-and-so, forget it, I try to protect the sheep around here as much as possible, but I cannot stand at all the doors and filter out some of the panhandlers that come through.</p>
<p>So every now and then you have to be alert when we have these conferences so that you don&rsquo;t get taken in by someone of this sort. There will not be a tour of TNP Saturday night. It was announced, but it won&rsquo;t be. So we can cancel that on the agenda.</p>
<p>Now in preparation for the study of the Word of God this evening, the next few moments are devoted to silent prayer. The objective is to give you privacy of the priesthood in order that you might <span class="theological-term">rebound</span> if necessary, and in order that you might be <span class="theological-term">filled with the Spirit</span>, which is the only approach to the Word of God.</p>
<p>The Lord once said to Moses, take off your shoes, you stand on holy ground. In this dispensation, it&rsquo;s be filled with the Spirit that you might take in the Word of God.</p>
<p>The only holy ground we have is the canon of Scripture, and it is impossible, no matter how smart you are, even if you&rsquo;re a genius, it&rsquo;s impossible to take in the Word of God. Unless the <span class="theological-term">Holy Spirit</span>, who <span class="theological-term">indwells</span> you, also controls your life.</p>
<p>This can only be accomplished by being in <span class="theological-term">fellowship</span>. This can only be fulfilled by the rebound technique.</p>
<p>And therefore, to give you privacy for preparation for the study of the Word of God, let us pray. (allow a moment for confession)</p>
<p>We are grateful to thee, Heavenly Father, that ours is the privilege of spending this holiday around the Word of God. Every day that we are consistent in taking in the Word, this is just that much closer to the <span class="theological-term">super-grace</span> life and to the <span class="theological-term">capacity for happiness</span> which belongs to the super-grace believer.</p>
<p>Now, Father, we recognize that this is the day when families get together, and this is the day when many people who do not have families are lonely and left out. We thank thee that we can gather around the Word of God tonight where no one is left out, where no one is excluded.</p>
<p>And so, as we fellowship in the Word of God tonight, whatever many have missed by way of the family gatherings or by way of eating or dining or having fellowship with someone today, we pray that God the Holy Spirit will provide for them, as for all of us, that manna from heaven, that bread of life which is so important in our daily walk.</p>
<p>To that end, we ask that God the Holy Spirit will sanctify this spiritual food to the nourishment of our souls.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>First Samuel, chapter 16, verse 13. Ordinarily, I would try to review, but we have a long way to go this weekend. And if you weren&rsquo;t here this morning, that&rsquo;s too bad.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll have to catch it on tape, which one of my friends calls instant replay. All right, in verse 13. Then Samuel took the horn of oil.</p>
<p>The horn of oil is the way in which a commission was given in the ancient world. And anointed him, this is David. The word anointed, the word anointed, is the <span class="hebrew">cal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">mashach</span>.</p>
<p>M-A-S-H-A-C-H. And in the <span class="hebrew">cal</span> stem, this means to commission. And this is God&rsquo;s promise that David will someday be king.</p>
<p>And I want you to notice that David was promoted by the promise of God, but not the reality of experience at the time that he reached <span class="theological-term">super grace</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>God did not leave David in doubt that someday he would be the king of Israel. But before he reaches that point, there will be many tests, and he will have many opportunities to see the grace of God in action.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>So he anointed him in the midst of his brethren. There were seven brothers beside David. All of them had the same opportunity to take in doctrine.</p>
<p>Only one of them made it. Now, here&rsquo;s a family of eight boys. One of them is in super grace.</p>
<p>The rest are non-entities in <span class="theological-term">reversionism</span>. Attractive non-entities, talented non-entities, even smart non-entities, but totally without anything. What makes the difference?</p>
<p>Lest you forget, I want to remind you again and again that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> in the soul is the thing that makes the difference.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>All of these boys had the same father and the same mother. All of these boys were brothers, so that they had, within a relative range, the same genes, roughly the same talents and abilities.</p>
<p>All of them, apparently, were very attractive, very handsome. All of them seemed to be reasonably smart, if not very wise. Only one of them ever made it.</p>
<p>Only one of them ever achieved greatness. They all had the same opportunity. They all had the same background.</p>
<p>They all had the same environment. Only one of them ever made it. And that one is David.</p>
<p>Later on, when we study his name, you&rsquo;ll begin to see something as to why. But right now, in anticipation, David was the only one who consistently <span class="theological-term">gapped</span> it to super grace. And at the time of this anointing, David&rsquo;s about 18 years old, and he is a super-grace believer.</p>
<p>He has already arrived at that point. So he was anointed in the midst of his brethren. And then we read, The Spirit of the Lord came upon him.</p>
<p>Now, this is actually <span class="hebrew">Ruach Elohim</span>, R-U-A-C-H-E-L-A-O-H-I-M, the Spirit of <span class="hebrew">Elohim</span>, the Spirit of God. This is a reference to God the Holy Spirit. It came upon him, this is the <span class="hebrew">cal</span> imperfect, from the verb <span class="hebrew">salak</span>.</p>
<p>T-S-A-L-A-C-H, <span class="hebrew">salak</span>. <span class="hebrew">Salak</span> means a lot of things, but it means, for example, to pass over. It means to prosper.</p>
<p>Here it means to descend upon, to produce prosperity. God the Holy Spirit descended upon David to produce prosperity. Now, you have to remember that David has been a believer for a long time.</p>
<p>David is a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. He has personally received Christ as his Savior. He has been saved long enough to enter super grace, which means he&rsquo;s probably been saved for at least six or seven or maybe eight or nine years.</p>
<p>He has been consistent in the function of gap. And this is his first contact, at least the first recorded contact, with God the Holy Spirit. Now, notice the difference.</p>
<p>The moment that you believed in Jesus Christ, God the Holy Spirit <span class="theological-term">indwelt</span> you. God the Holy Spirit made his home in you as of the moment you were saved, and he will never leave. Now, you may be filled with the Spirit in fellowship, or you may <span class="theological-term">grieve the Spirit</span> or <span class="theological-term">quench the Spirit</span>.</p>
<p>But God the Holy Spirit always resides in you. This means there&rsquo;s a difference. And this is the difference.</p>
<p>In the dispensation of Israel, the ministry of God the Holy Spirit was much different from what it is today. The reason being that the Lord Jesus Christ had not come in the flesh, had not gone to the cross, and had not ascended to the right hand of the Father. In other words, the Holy Spirit was not yet given because Christ was not yet glorified.</p>
<p>Now, there&rsquo;s a difference here. And here is the principle.</p>
<h3 id="the-doctrine-of-the-ministry-of-the-holy-spirit-in-the-age-of-israel">The Doctrine of the Ministry of the Holy Spirit in the Age of Israel</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The Holy Spirit indwelt some Old Testament believers to perform special functions.</strong> But he did not indwell all believers, or even 90% of believers in any generation.</p>
<p><strong>Nine illustrations of the ministry of the Holy Spirit to an Old Testament saint:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Joseph - Genesis 41:38</li>
<li>The artisans who constructed the tabernacle - Exodus 28:3 and 31:3</li>
<li>The elders or administrators who assisted Moses - Numbers 11:18, 25</li>
<li>Joshua - Numbers 27:18</li>
<li>The judges - For example, Othniel (Judges 3:10), Gideon (Judges 6:4, 34), Jephthah (Judges 11:29), Samson (Judges 13:25; 14:6; 15:14)</li>
<li>Kings of Israel - Saul (1 Samuel 10:9-10), David (1 Samuel 16:13, our passage)</li>
<li>Daniel - Daniel 4:8; 5:11-12</li>
<li>Post-exilic rulers - Zechariah 4:3, 12, 14</li>
<li>Old Testament writers - 1 Peter 1:11</li>
</ol>
<p>It was very rare for God the Holy Spirit to ever have any ministry to an ordinary believer. For example, God the Holy Spirit had no relationship with the father of David, Jesse. He had no relationship with his eldest brother, Eliab. He had no relationship with any of his other brothers. He had no relationship with anyone in David&rsquo;s family, even though they were believers. Only with David. Only special believers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The believers who had God the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament could be disciplined by the removal of God the Holy Spirit.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The case of Saul - 1 Samuel 16:14 (our next verse)</li>
<li>The case of David - Psalm 51:11 (where David prayed that the Holy Spirit would not be taken from him)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Believers of the Old Testament could obtain the Holy Spirit by request.</strong> They could ask for the Holy Spirit (2 Kings 2:9-10; Luke 11:13). Hold the place and turn to Luke 11.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one that needs a little explanation due to the fact that the Holy Rollers have corrupted it. We&rsquo;ll start at Luke 11, 9. By the way, if you&rsquo;re a Holy Roller, a Pentecostal, a four-square, then you&rsquo;re out of place.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t belong here. This is where the Word of God is taught. This is where Jesus Christ is honored.</p>
<p>And you are in apostasy. If you think that you&rsquo;ve spoken in tongues, then you are a confused, mixed-up person. You&rsquo;re possibly a psychopathic personality.</p>
<p>And you may even be in psychotic reversionism. But I&rsquo;ll tell you one thing. You&rsquo;re in the wrong pew.</p>
<p>There is nothing but evil connected with the Holy Rollers, the whole tongues movement, and they are not welcome in this place at any time. We separate ourselves from religious evil. It is demonism that keeps this organization going.</p>
<p>And even though believers cannot be <span class="theological-term">demon-possessed</span>, they can be under demon influence by the opening of the matiotes of the soul through negative volition toward doctrine. If you are a Holy Roller, you&rsquo;re in the wrong place. And I&rsquo;ll tell you nose to nose and face to face how evil, how vicious, how monstrous is the tongues movement, any time, anywhere.</p>
<p>Now, that&rsquo;s what happened to this passage, and that&rsquo;s why we need to stop and take a look. Luke 11, 9. And I say unto you, Jesus is talking to the disciples.</p>
<p>Understand that they can have the Holy Spirit on request. He wants them to further understand that they need the Holy Spirit badly because they are Old Testament saints at the moment, and they need to be sustained by the ministry of God the Holy Spirit. So he says, &ldquo;Ask, and it shall be given you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is to ask for the Holy Spirit. Many of you have quoted this as a promise, and really, the principle is there, but you have no right to use this in your prayer promises. You can ask until you overflow and effervesce, but you still aren&rsquo;t going to get what you want under this passage.</p>
<p>Ask, and it shall be given you. Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</p>
<p>Knocking is importunity in prayer. For everyone that asketh receiveth. This is an Old Testament saint.</p>
<p>He that seeketh findeth. To him that knocketh it shall be opened. In other words, Jesus is telling the disciples, You need the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>And then he illustrates in verse 11, If a son shall ask bread of anyone who is a father, will he give him a stone? Your son is hungry and wants some food. You don&rsquo;t give him a stone to chew on.</p>
<p>Not a normal father, anyway. Or if he asks a fish, will he instead of a fish give him a snake? And the answer is no.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s ludicrous. So this is illustration by the ludicrous. Or if he shall ask for an egg, even soft boil, once over easy, instead of once over easy, will he put a scorpion on his plate?</p>
<p>And the answer is no. Now, verse 13, If therefore you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them who ask for him. Now, this was the pattern for the Old Testament.</p>
<p>There were two ways you could get the Holy Spirit as a believer. One, God at some time during your <span class="theological-term">phase two</span> experience sovereignly bestowed the Holy Spirit as he did in the case of David. Or two, certain believers could ask and receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>This was the only way that believers could have a relationship with the Holy Spirit in Old Testament times. So point three again, believers of the Old Testament could obtain the Holy Spirit by request. Now, before you get back, turn to John chapter 20, verse 22 for point four.</p>
<p>John 20, 22.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Just before the ascension and without their request, since they never did ask, Jesus gave the Holy Spirit to ten of the disciples.</strong> Of course, he didn&rsquo;t give it to Judas Iscariot.</li>
</ol>
<p>He&rsquo;s an unbeliever. Thomas wasn&rsquo;t there, so Thomas didn&rsquo;t get in on it. But God the Holy Spirit was given to the disciples minus Thomas to sustain them for fifty days between the resurrection and the day of Pentecost.</p>
<p>John 20, 22. And when he had said this, Jesus is speaking, he breathed on them and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit. The Greek word is pneuma.</p>
<p>There is no word for ghost in the Greek. Receive ye the Holy Spirit. So God the Holy Spirit was given to ten of the disciples because God knew that the disciples could not last fifty days without divine help.</p>
<p>And therefore, the last fifty days before the age of Israel was interrupted by the church age, God the Holy Spirit was provided for the knuckleheaded disciples.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>Once the church age begins, every believer is indwelled by God the Holy Spirit.</strong> Every believer. John 7:37-39; John 14:16-17; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:19-20. Furthermore, every believer in the church age is commanded to be <span class="theological-term">filled with the Spirit</span> (Ephesians 5:18; Galatians 5:16). A rebound technique is the means of fulfilling that command.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>In the church age, the believer cannot lose the indwelling Holy Spirit. He can only lose the filling of the Spirit.</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Personal sin.
At the point of salvation,
every believer enters
into union with Christ.
That&rsquo;s the top circle.
Every believer also
enters into fellowship
with God in time.
This is the place
of the filling of the Spirit.
When you sin,
you&rsquo;re <span class="theological-term">carnal</span>,
<span class="theological-term">out of fellowship</span>.
When you rebound,
you come back
under the filling of the Spirit again.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>In the previous dispensation (the age of Israel), the Holy Spirit regenerated at the point of salvation. But now, in the church age, God the Holy Spirit accomplishes five things at the point of salvation.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>People were saved
in Old Testament times
the same way
they are saved right now,
by believing in Christ.
Christ was revealed
in a little different manner,
because the canon of Scripture
was not yet completed,
and because the Incarnation
had not occurred historically.
But,
people were still saved
the same way.
Abraham believed
in the Lord,
and it was credited
to his account
for righteousness,
Genesis 15, 6.
Now,
at the point of <span class="theological-term">regeneration</span>,
God the Holy Spirit
accomplished it
for Old Testament saints.
He did one thing
at the point of salvation
for the Old Testament believer.
But,
he does five
of the 36 things
in this dispensation.
The first, then,
is regeneration,
John 3, 5,
and Titus 3, 5.
Secondly,
<span class="theological-term">the baptism of the Spirit</span>,
Acts 1, 5,
1 Corinthians 12, 13.
That&rsquo;s the ministry
whereby God the Holy Spirit
enters every believer
into union with Christ.
And it is,
in contrast,
to regeneration,
whereby God the Holy Spirit
causes us to be born
into the family of God.
So we&rsquo;re all born
into the family of God
the same way,
the ministry of the Spirit.
The third thing God does,
the God the Holy Spirit does,
is to stamp us
with a seal.
We are sealed
by the ministry of the Spirit,
2 Corinthians 1, 22,
Ephesians 1, 13, and 4, 30.
This guarantees <span class="theological-term">eternal security</span>.
4.
He sovereignly
and graciously
bestows upon every believer
at least one <span class="theological-term">spiritual gift</span>.
1 Corinthians 12, 12 and 13.
One spiritual gift
for every believer.
And 5.
He indwells every believer
at the point of salvation,
Romans 8, 9,
1 Corinthians 3, 16,
1 Corinthians 6, 19 and 20,
Galatians 3, 2.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><strong>In John 7:39, we have a principle: The Holy Spirit was not yet given because Christ was not yet glorified.</strong>
In John chapter 20,
verse 22,
the Holy Spirit was given
under the conditions
specified for Old Testament saints.
Therefore,
the ministry of the Holy Spirit
for the 50 days
before Pentecost
was an Old Testament ministry.
All right.
Verse 14.
1 Samuel 6, 14.
David did not ask for the Holy Spirit.
David did not solicit
the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
God the Holy Spirit
sovereignly came to help David
at the point of his anointing.
From that time on,
David was pinpointed
in the <span class="theological-term">angelic conflict</span>.
David was to be the key
for the whole <span class="theological-term">Davidic covenant</span>,
for the <span class="theological-term">Messianic line</span>,
and therefore God the Holy Spirit
will act as his protector
in the spiritual conflict
and will empower and endue him
for the conflicts
which he must face on earth.
But remember
that the primary source of power
for any Old Testament saint
was the Bible doctrine content
in his soul.
1 Samuel 16, 14.
But the Spirit of the Lord,
<span class="hebrew">Ruach Adonai</span>,
R-U-A-C-H,
R-U-A-C-H, Jehovah.
This is a reference again
to God the Holy Spirit.
<span class="hebrew">Ruach Adonai</span> refers to the Holy Spirit
whose ministry in the previous dispensation
was specialized,
and therefore,
as part of reversionistic discipline,
the Spirit was removed from Saul.
So the Holy Spirit departed.
The cow perfect of <span class="hebrew">sewer</span>,
<span class="hebrew">sewer</span> usually means to desert,
desert.
Here it just means to be removed.
And this was a permanent thing.
Saul is now officially in <span class="theological-term">reversionism</span>. For him to get there, Saul had to go negative toward Bible doctrine.
That&rsquo;s taught in 1 Chronicles 10, 13, and 14.
Then he had to get <span class="theological-term">scar tissue</span>
on the left bank of his soul.
And then he had to begin
a frantic search for happiness
which put scar tissue
on the right bank of his soul.
And then he had <span class="theological-term">emotional revolt</span>
of the soul,
and at the same time
the attack of <span class="theological-term">Mataiotes</span>.
This is why he has <span class="theological-term">demon influence</span>
in his life.
King Saul was a believer
under demon influence.
And then,
after emotional revolt,
he began to practice
reverse process reversionism.
And while at this stage
he is a mental attitude reversionist,
before this chapter is over,
he has his first attack
of manic depressive,
and he becomes a psychotic,
a periodic <span class="theological-term">psychotic reversionism</span>.
Most people who become psychotic
always do so
by way of <span class="theological-term">mental attitude sins</span>.
jealousy,
bitterness,
vindictiveness,
implacability,
hatred,
guilt complex.
Many people crack up
with guilt complex.
No one ever simply jumped
into a psychotic condition,
not unless they had it inherently.
Most people become psychotic.
They acquire that condition
of mental illness,
and they do so,
first of all,
by mental attitude sins
in the soul.
At this point,
David is commissioned
king of Israel,
and eventually he will arrive there.
The promise is given
through the anointing.
Many times David
will have to remember
this anointing.
Many times this anointing
will be a temptation
to cut some corners.
But David always waited
on the Lord.
David is one of the greatest
believers of all time.
He had the capacity.
He had the doctrine.
He knew that God
could give
as no one
could ever give.
He understood
something of the character
of God,
something of God&rsquo;s
capacity to give,
something of God&rsquo;s
ability to give,
and therefore
always David
came back to this.
In other words,
David as a born-again
believer
had so much information
on the essence box
that he didn&rsquo;t need
promises
like you often
need promises.
In fact,
he cooked up
some of the promises
in the Psalms
and elsewhere.
Why?
Because
David as a
super-grace believer
was occupied
with the person
of Christ.
There is only
one celebrity
for believers
in any dispensation.
There are many
super-grace heroes,
but one celebrity,
and that one celebrity
is the Lord Jesus Christ.
And David was
completely occupied
with the person
of Christ,
and therefore
many times
he demonstrated
how he could
wait on the Lord.
He was promoted
in a wonderful way
in Saul&rsquo;s court.
He went back
to the sheep.
Many, many times
he could have gone
the human viewpoint route,
and he could have
achieved some fame.
But David took
the attitude,
if God doesn&rsquo;t
promote you,
you&rsquo;re not promoted.
And many times
when David could
have advanced himself,
he refused to do so.
He would stop
and say,
if God doesn&rsquo;t
provide it for me,
I don&rsquo;t want it.
When God provides it,
it&rsquo;s permanent
and it&rsquo;s wonderful
and I have the capacity
for it.
But if God doesn&rsquo;t
provide it,
it&rsquo;s not worth it.
And therefore
I will wait
until God provides it.
And God is fair
and God is righteous
and God has never
let one believer down
and God has provided
things for me
in eternity past
that I know not of
as yet.
But I will know
these things.
I will wait
for these things.
Now you can&rsquo;t say
that tonight
unless you have
achieved
super grace.
And some of you
aren&rsquo;t even close.
So don&rsquo;t try
to run around
and mouth
empty words.
You have to back it
with doctrine
in your soul
and if you don&rsquo;t
have doctrine
in your soul,
you&rsquo;re not ready
for that yet.
And I suppose
that you will
cut corners
and you will
try to push
yourself
and you will
try to PR
yourself into
something.</li>
</ol>
<p>have.</p>
<p>But you will try and try and try but the people who are really going to make it are the people who hit Bible class every day or hit that button every day. As some of my friends tell me, I have a friend, an old buddy from pre-World War two days, he was a Navy pilot and he says he likes me on instant replay. He says he can punch the button, go back, go over it again.</p>
<p>Well, that&rsquo;s fine. As long as you get it one way or another, you must have <span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> in your soul. That&rsquo;s the thing that really counts.</p>
<p>And until you get doctrine in your soul, don&rsquo;t try to con God. Just keep on calling God names. Just keep right on using him as a patsy.</p>
<p>Keep on saying to God, why did you let this happen to me? Because you&rsquo;re a jackass and you might as well be honest about it and keep blaspheming until you get enough doctrine to come out of the woods and straighten up. Now in verse 14 again, but the spirit of the Lord, the Holy Spirit departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled, hand.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to spend too much time here, but I think you should understand this evil spirit. It&rsquo;s <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span>, <span class="hebrew">Ra&rsquo;ah</span>, the Hebrew. Let&rsquo;s start with the Hebrew.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s get, here, there it is, R-U-A-C-H-R-A-A-H. <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span>, <span class="hebrew">Ra&rsquo;ah</span>. <span class="hebrew">Ra&rsquo;ah</span> is the noun here for evil.</p>
<p>Now <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span> means breath, life, inspiration, spirit. We have just seen <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span> used for a title for the Holy Spirit, but that&rsquo;s the only way it becomes a title for the Holy Spirit. <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span> must be with either the <span class="hebrew">Tetragrammaton</span> or occasionally you will find <span class="hebrew">Elohim</span>, but generally when it&rsquo;s <span class="hebrew">Elohim</span> it means from God rather than of God.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t God in other words, it&rsquo;s something distinct from God. So we have <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span>, <span class="hebrew">Ra&rsquo;ah</span>, referring to, get this now, not a person, not even a demon, but inward depression, melancholy, leading to psychosis. In other words, when Saul went into reversionism, he began to become depressed, he began to be melancholy, he was filled with self-pity, and eventually his reversionism led him to psychosis.</p>
<p>Now we have to remember once again there are three phases to reversionistic discipline. The first is the phase where God knocks on the door, so we&rsquo;ll call that the knocking phase. Behold, I stand at the door and knock.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s discipline from God as a warning that reversionism is here, and it&rsquo;s a warning to rebound and to get back with Bible doctrine. The second phase is intensity. The intensity stage, that&rsquo;s the one where you&rsquo;re psyched.</p>
<p>Here we have mental attitude sins. This is Saul. When you go from that, that&rsquo;s the warning stage.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s self-induced misery and everything else that&rsquo;s produced along with it. But when you get to the psycho stage or the psychopathic stage sometimes, then you get intensity. And then finally there is the dying stage, <span class="theological-term">the sin unto death</span>.</p>
<p>This requires repentance, this requires repentance, repentance, and both of them require getting back to authority. We saw this under James 5. This one requires rebound and back to doctrine.</p>
<p>Now, actually, <span class="hebrew">ruach ra&rsquo;ah</span> is the first stage, the warning stage. The word trouble also helps us to understand that this is not a demon, this is not a person, this is a state of the soul. <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span> indicates that which is invisible but real, therefore something in the soul.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is sometimes inspiration, sometimes breath, sometimes even life. But here, the evil spirit refers to the inward depression which characterizes the first stage of reversionistic discipline. The word trouble is the <span class="hebrew">P.L.</span> perfect of <span class="hebrew">Ba&rsquo;at</span>.</p>
<p>Looks like this. B-A-A-T. Now, <span class="hebrew">Ba&rsquo;at</span>, in the <span class="hebrew">P.L.</span> stem, of course, is a very intense stem.</p>
<p>In the cow stem, for example, <span class="hebrew">Ba&rsquo;at</span> would mean to be frightened. But in the <span class="hebrew">P.L.</span> stem, it means to be totally, completely terrified, to bereft of the ability to think, and therefore to be terrified.</p>
<p>The spirit of the Lord, the Holy Spirit, departed from Saul. There is the beginning of discipline for reversionism. While a spirit of evil discipline from the Lord, it was evil to Saul, but anything from the Lord is not evil.</p>
<p>It means evil discipline. Terrified him. In other words, he began to have serious mental aberrations which are indicative of the beginning of a psychotic condition.</p>
<p>He was mentally ill. And as a result of that, in verses 15, we see his problem recognized. In verse 16, we see the solution sought.</p>
<p>In verse 17, we have Saul agreeing to some therapy. Let&rsquo;s notice one or two things in passing here. Saul&rsquo;s servants do not mean his servants, like you use the word servant.</p>
<p>These are people high in his government. It could be his secretary of state or his chief of staff. It could be any one of these people.</p>
<p>These are high-ranking officers in his government. And Saul&rsquo;s officers said to him, Behold now, you have trouble in the soul. Evil spirit is used here for mental illness from God indicates this is divine discipline.</p>
<p>And again, we have the word trouble, <span class="hebrew">ba-ad</span> again in the <span class="hebrew">P-A-L</span> stamp, to terrify you. Let our Lord now command thy servants, the officers, before you to find someone to help you, to seek out a man who is, get this, now this is their suggestion, musical therapy.</p>
<p>Not a cunning player, we don&rsquo;t need any cunning types around, this is skillful. A skillful player on a harp. I want you to please note, some of you, no rock music, no drums.</p>
<p>A player on a harp. This is the great-great grandfather of the piano. They just turned it sideways and called it a harpsichord and eventually became a piano.</p>
<p>And it shall come to pass when the mental illness from the Lord is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. Actually, it&rsquo;s his hands. He didn&rsquo;t play with one hand, he played with both.</p>
<p>And thou shalt be well. And Saul said to his officers, provide me. This is <span class="hebrew">ra-ah</span> again, <span class="hebrew">kel</span>, imperative of that word we had this morning so many times, r-a-h-h, and it means look for someone for me, a man that can play well and bring him to me.</p>
<p>All right, this introduces now a man for a crisis, a super-grace type. 1 Samuel 16, verses 18 through 23. Then answered one of the officers in the government and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse.</p>
<p>Here it is, the <span class="hebrew">kel</span>, perfect, of <span class="hebrew">ra-ah</span>, r-a-h. This means to observe, I have observed a son of Jesse. When God promotes a man, people are going to discover him at just the right moment.</p>
<p>If God doesn&rsquo;t promote, then he will play to the sheep. Where did David learn to play this harp, this musical instrument? He learned that the sheep, at night, when the wolves and the animals, various types of predatory animals, lions, bears, are hovering near the flock and looking for an opportunity to snatch a quick Thanksgiving dinner, David, the sheep sense these predatory animals and are frightened.</p>
<p>And so David would sit in the midst of his flock and he&rsquo;d play to them and this would calm them down. This is the way shepherds have operated for thousands of years. So he was skilled on a musical instrument.</p>
<p>I have seen a skillful, the word cunning, by the way, is a calactive participle of a verb with which you&rsquo;re familiar from the days of Psalm 119. <span class="hebrew">Yadah</span> means to know. The calactive participle means to keep on knowing, to know well, and therefore a skillful player.</p>
<p>Now I want you to notice the next thing very carefully. The Jews had a reserve system and they had a system for training young men for military. And David had taken some military training.</p>
<p>He would take time off each summer and go to summer camp and take some training. I want you to notice what it says about him. He is said to be a mighty, valiant man.</p>
<p>Now in the Hebrew, this is <span class="hebrew">givor kajil</span>. Looks like this.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Givor kajil</span> means someone who has successfully gone through his training. It&rsquo;s translated a mighty, valiant man. But it actually means a man who is well prepared.</p>
<p>Today, this would be something like maybe an airborne ranger. He&rsquo;s passed all of the tough things. Or in a pathfinder.</p>
<p>Or someone who&rsquo;s really been through something tough. Not the usual kind of stuff where you can write your congressman and everybody collapses and all the rest of it. But in something where he had proved himself.</p>
<p>In other words, David wore a patch. And the patch said <span class="hebrew">givor kajil</span>. When he put on his uniform, he had a patch.</p>
<p>And that means he&rsquo;s tough, trained, well versed in how to kill people. So he could pull a string off his piano, his harp, and he could throttle someone with it. He knew all the ways to kill people with his bare hands.</p>
<p>And every born-again believer ought to know these things. I know I&rsquo;ve also read the Sermon on the Mount. The Sermon on the Mount is for the millennium.</p>
<p>Not for today. Not even close. The Sermon on the Mount was Jesus presenting a platform for the millennium.</p>
<p>And when the swords are turned into plowshares and the spears into pruning hooks, the citizens of the millennium can turn the other cheek. The only way to turn the other cheek now is to roll with a punch and come up with a counterpunch. Usually if you turn the other cheek, you roll and you bend your elbow and hook.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the only turning of the other cheek for the church age and the tribulation. So get that nonsense out of your head. That belongs to the libs, the bleeding hearts, the national council of churches, and all of the other religious apostates and reversionists of this world.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a part of communist propaganda today. But it doesn&rsquo;t belong to you as a believer in Jesus Christ. Now David had never been to war.</p>
<p>David had just been in training. And all this means here, <span class="hebrew">Givor Kayil</span>, is that he had been well trained in certain facets of military life and had passed well. And so he&rsquo;s called a man of war, <span class="hebrew">Ishmil Kamah</span>, I-S-H-M-I-L-C-A-M-A-H.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Ishmil Kamah</span> simply means that he was a well-trained reservist and could be called up. By the way, he never was called up except by God at the right time. But he has had military training.</p>
<p>Now God the Holy Spirit put this in at this point. He&rsquo;s not going to use the ordinary accoutrements of warfare. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m sure he went through ranger school because they considered an insult to have to kill somebody with a conventional type way.</p>
<p>They can do it other ways that are much better. Very neat. And a lot of satisfaction out of strangling someone with a piece of piano wire or using a short dirk of some kind or breaking someone&rsquo;s back by just the right movement at the right time.</p>
<p>Just snap his backbone and step on his communist face and march on. So David is trained in these things. He is not trained in conventional weapons.</p>
<p>But he is trained to fight. And by the way, God the Holy Spirit put this in here. And also this is a reminder to any of you so-called conscientious objectors, you yellow-bellied cowards who don&rsquo;t understand Bible doctrine and wouldn&rsquo;t fight for your country.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s just a reminder to you that you&rsquo;re out of line completely. There&rsquo;s no such thing as a conscientious objector. God has ordained that freedom will be gained by the use of the military.</p>
<p>And some of you chaps could do well to cut off your hair and enlist. Because you&rsquo;re cowards and you&rsquo;re freeloaders and you&rsquo;re parasites on this free society. And this society is free because men put on the uniform of this country and fought for this country.</p>
<p>All right, I have seen a skillful musician. But that isn&rsquo;t all. You can bring him into the court.</p>
<p>Apparently, the person who made the recommendation was an undersecretary of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Something about David. And the reason he knows something about David is because when David went off for training, reserve training, why, at night in the barracks, he&rsquo;d play. And apparently, this guy made an inspection and heard David play.</p>
<p>So he&rsquo;s impressed with David. He says, David already has graduated from certain of our schools where he is already an official soldier. He&rsquo;s an <span class="hebrew">ish</span>, <span class="hebrew">mil</span>, <span class="hebrew">kamah</span>.</p>
<p>He is also <span class="hebrew">givor</span>, <span class="hebrew">kayil</span>. And that isn&rsquo;t all. This undersecretary from DOD, this fugitive from the squirrel cage, has another thing to say.</p>
<p>He says he is prudent in matters. Now, what do you suppose he means by prudent in matters? Well, we have <span class="hebrew">Navon Davar</span>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out what this is all about by starting with the original. N-E-B-O-N, pronounced <span class="hebrew">Navon</span>. D-A-B-A-R, pronounced <span class="hebrew">Davar</span>.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Navon Davar</span>. What is a <span class="hebrew">Navon Davar</span>? It means a person who is unusually learned, learned in doctrine, constantly perceiving doctrine.</p>
<p>You see, <span class="hebrew">Navon</span> is the <span class="hebrew">Nifel</span> participle of being, which we&rsquo;ve also had before. Being is one of the verbs for perception of Bible doctrine. And in the <span class="hebrew">Nifel</span> stem, it can be either passive or reflexive.</p>
<p>Here it&rsquo;s reflexive. This person himself has learned a lot of doctrine. Now, I want you to notice four things were noted.</p>
<p>An undersecretary from the Department of Defense has said, one, he&rsquo;s skillful as a musician. Two, he is <span class="hebrew">Givor Kayil</span>, which is a mighty, valiant man. He has gone through the toughest schools.</p>
<p>And thirdly, he is <span class="hebrew">Ish-Mil-Kamah</span>, a man of war. He is qualified as a soldier. And four, he is strong for Bible doctrine.</p>
<p>And then one more thing is mentioned, the fifth, a comely person. <span class="hebrew">Ish-Toh-Er</span>. I-S-H-T-O-A-R.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Ish-Toh-Er</span>. <span class="hebrew">To-Er</span> really means handsome in appearance. So he is a man handsome in appearance.</p>
<p>One more thing that is now mentioned. And this is the super-grace hero. The Lord is with him.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Adonai-Emole</span>. All right. Corrected translation.</p>
<p>Then one of the staff answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem, skillful in playing a musical instrument, a hero of great valor, that&rsquo;s his patch, a professional soldier, that&rsquo;s his training, constantly learning doctrine, that&rsquo;s his life, a man of handsome appearance, that&rsquo;s his inheritance from his father and mother. Moreover, the Lord is with him. That&rsquo;s super-grace.</p>
<p>Whatever else could be said about you, two of these things can belong to you any time you decide to go that way. Constantly learning doctrine and the Lord with you. Now, verse 19.</p>
<p>Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep, how did they know that? They read his 66-2. They had a whole file on him.</p>
<p>All they went to DOD and just checked his file. They found out that he was working with the sheep. Now, that with the sheep is important.</p>
<p>David was faithful in the little things. Let&rsquo;s review what he has in verse 18. First of all, he&rsquo;s skillful with a musical instrument.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a good musician. Secondly, he has graduated from the toughest military schools. Thirdly, he is a professional soldier.</p>
<p>Fourthly, he is constantly learning doctrine. Four, he&rsquo;s handsome in appearance, and the Lord is with him. Now, all of these things add up.</p>
<p>You would think by now he would probably have a desk up in one of the more secret offices of DOD. You would think perhaps he&rsquo;d at least be the recruiting officer in Bethlehem. But he is none of these things.</p>
<p>Why? He is waiting on the Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If the Lord doesn&rsquo;t promote you, you&rsquo;re not promoted.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>If the Lord doesn&rsquo;t give it to you, you don&rsquo;t have it. Now, that&rsquo;s important. Once again, verse 18.</p>
<p>Then one of the staff answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse.</p>
<p>is family relationship of Bethlehem. That&rsquo;s his hometown. Skillful in playing.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s a musician. A hero of great valor. That&rsquo;s his special patch.</p>
<p>A professional soldier. He&rsquo;s completed his military training. He&rsquo;s a reservist.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s constantly learning doctrine. Super grace. A man of handsome appearance.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s from the inheritance from his family. The Lord is with him. Super grace function.</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s he doing? He&rsquo;s with the sheep. You notice something strange there?</p>
<p>David, with all of these things going for him, is not pushing David. Did you ever see someone who was ambitious and pushy? Every now and then you run into some guy who&rsquo;s really ambitious and he wants to be a great preacher and he wants to cut a wide swath down through fundamentalism and he&rsquo;s already taping his own messages and sending them to his mother.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s just fantastic how some of these birds operate. They&rsquo;re real pushy. And that isn&rsquo;t all.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re depending upon someone to help push. So they hook up with the denomination. So they hook up with some seminary.</p>
<p>They try to get some seminary president to recommend them here and there. They have to have someone to sponsor them. I want you to notice something, all of you who are sponsor conscious.</p>
<p>Who sponsored David? I&rsquo;ll tell you who didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s his father, Jesse.</p>
<p>Jesse spent all of his money putting seven sons through school. But David mocks Nix. Nothing for David.</p>
<p>David just kept the sheep. David, you keep working on the sheep till we get all of your fine brothers through school. And maybe there will be something left over for you.</p>
<p>No one pushes David, not even his father, Jesse, which all goes to prove that Jesse was a dope, too. He was a real dodo. Jesse, in fact, you&rsquo;re going to see how stupid he was, a leader in reversionism.</p>
<p>Every time we see Jesse this weekend, he&rsquo;s either bribing a battalion commander to promote Eliab, or he&rsquo;s sending a present to the king so that he will do something special for one of his sons. Every time you see Jesse, Jesse reminds me of a fond mother who&rsquo;s always writing her congressman to get her boy ahead or to make sure that his cookies are delivered to the barracks, special delivery, preferably by the company commander. Jesse&rsquo;s an ass.</p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t understand a basic thing in life. Why? Because he&rsquo;s reversionistic himself.</p>
<p>You know, don&rsquo;t you get a little creepy once in a while going through this passage? Everywhere you turn, you run into a reversionist. Saul&rsquo;s psychotic.</p>
<p>Jesse&rsquo;s trying to bribe a cycle to help his sons. Eliab thinks he&rsquo;s important and is so taken with his importance that he&rsquo;ll have a sneer or two in the next chapter. Just think we&rsquo;re going to give Eliab a line.</p>
<p>This big, tall, handsome jackass actually talks. Believe it or not, he&rsquo;ll talk tomorrow. Oh, it&rsquo;s tragic to see so many.</p>
<p>Like Samuel weeping for Saul, who&rsquo;s a psycho. Everywhere you turn, you have reversionism. What a horrible place to be.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something. The United States of America, for the first time in its history, has become a horrible place to be. Why?</p>
<p>Because everywhere you turn, it&rsquo;s reversionism, reversionism, reversionism. Everything that&rsquo;s said. How many times have your employers, many of you who work for someone, they want you to grow sideburns and long hair, because that&rsquo;s the in thing of all the jackass things.</p>
<p>Here you are, you can do a fabulous job for someone, and all they&rsquo;re worried about is how you look. Everywhere you turn, there&rsquo;s one outfit that just makes me sick. They&rsquo;re always catering to the communists anyway, and they make all of the people in their company wear little old tiny strings for ties.</p>
<p>What those strings are good for is to strangle them in a fight. The worst thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen. Everywhere you turn, somebody&rsquo;s got some human viewpoint gimmick.</p>
<p>Government: So they can have government contracts, or parts of contracts, or get a slice of the apple. Everywhere, everyone&rsquo;s got a gimmick. Everyone has a con artist approach to things.</p>
<p>Everyone is pushy, and that is the most uncomfortable, horrible place to be. And such a society breeds phonies faster. It breeds two things, phonies and parasites.</p>
<p>And then they play a little game. The parasites become phonies, and the phonies become parasites. And then we snap, snap, and they change places again.</p>
<p>Again, it&rsquo;s the most awful thing in the world. It&rsquo;s reversionism. And that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s very refreshing to see this one person who just wades through all of this stuff. He stays with the sheep until God promotes him. And even when God appears to promote him at one stage, he knows it&rsquo;s not a true promotion.</p>
<p>And you know what he does? He goes right back to the sheep. All right, this little phrase in verse 19, with the sheep.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the principle behind it. David was faithful in the little things. You put that down.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Faithfulness in the little things is much more important than being some kind of a big shot.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Faithfulness in the little things is better than having your <span class="theological-term">approbation lust</span> stimulated. Have you ever stopped to think, who calls the shots for being famous today?</p>
<p>Huh? Let&rsquo;s take football. Who&rsquo;s famous in football?</p>
<p>Who calls the shots? The people call the shots in football. So here&rsquo;s one kind of fame where it depends upon what a lot of people think.</p>
<p>So we&rsquo;ll call this hoi polloi fame. All right, how would you like to have hoi polloi fame? You know there are people around who have hoi polloi fame.</p>
<p>There are a lot of professional football players with their golden locks flowing down from their helmets. And they have hoi polloi fame. Why?</p>
<p>Because it&rsquo;s given to them by people. They do something well, people think they&rsquo;re great. They do two things well, people think they&rsquo;re super great.</p>
<p>So they&rsquo;re superstars, or they&rsquo;re stars, or they&rsquo;re great, or they&rsquo;re wonderful, or they&rsquo;re fine. And who says so? The general public says so.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what they say today. And so, football stars, if God hasn&rsquo;t promoted you, where are you tomorrow? Boo!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where you are tomorrow. And so what kind of fame is that? It&rsquo;s no fame at all.</p>
<p>Then, let&rsquo;s say you have another kind of fame, where you&rsquo;re in some, this is called business fame. You&rsquo;re in a business organization, and you&rsquo;re well thought of, and so people say, well, you stick around, we&rsquo;re going to use you, we&rsquo;re going to make you an executive, we&rsquo;re going to do this and that for you, we&rsquo;re going to promote you. And so after you lick some guy&rsquo;s shoes for 10 years, you get promoted to junior sub, vice sub, junior president, in charge of janitorial supplies for e-building left wing.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you lucky? Oh, you really worked hard, too. Why you have so much shoe polish on your tongue, you can&rsquo;t even say, thank you, sir.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s calling the shots? By the way, who&rsquo;s calling the shots in Christendom today? Who&rsquo;s a great preacher?</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s a great evangelist? Who&rsquo;s a great anything? A bunch of fundy idiots.</p>
<p>They have no concept of Bible doctrine. If God doesn&rsquo;t promote you, you just aren&rsquo;t promoted. Some of you had a lonely day today, probably wished you were married for the first time in six months.</p>
<p>Four walls. I&rsquo;ll do you one bit of that. I once had four walls and a roach going up.</p>
<p>There are a lot of married people that would have traded places with you. See, this is one of those big family days when the have-nots wish they had and the haves wish they had not. And everyone chokes on dressing.</p>
<p>Stuffed turkey. Let me tell you something. So you don&rsquo;t have a <span class="theological-term">right woman</span>.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s something worse. You could have the wrong woman. You don&rsquo;t have the <span class="theological-term">right man</span>, huh?</p>
<p>Something worse. You could have the wrong man.</p>
<p>In an organization, you surrender a certain amount of freedom. Those of you in single bliss, you have 100% freedom. The moment you join that organization called marriage, you lose some of it.</p>
<p>Freedom&rsquo;s a valuable thing. And yet you never lose freedom where it&rsquo;s right man or right woman. You only gain.</p>
<p>So, if God promotes you, fine. If he doesn&rsquo;t, stay away from it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If God doesn&rsquo;t give it to you, it&rsquo;s not worth having.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>If God does give it to you, latch on. You&rsquo;ve got something wonderful. And stay with doctrine so you can appreciate it.</p>
<p>But remember this, too. When God gives you something, he also demands responsibility for upkeep and proper use of saying. With the sheep.</p>
<p>All right. Get this now. Put it in your notes.</p>
<p>Every believer has his flock of sheep. Everyone has an area of relatively unpleasant circumstances where he&rsquo;s waiting. Are you willing to go to <span class="theological-term">super grace</span> first with your flock of sheep and then let the Lord introduce you to society or not?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where most believers miss the boat. They are not willing to <span class="theological-term">gap</span> it to super grace and then let the Lord promote them from a flock of sheep to something else. They want to, Now, Lord, I want it now, not tomorrow or the next day.</p>
<p>The rapture may occur the third day. I want it now. Uh-uh.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re out of line completely and totally. The only way you&rsquo;ll ever be happy with a flock of sheep is to take in <span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> every day. While David was with the sheep, he was prepared in many ways.</p>
<p>He became a great musician. He became, he had the best military training that Israel could provide. He had <span class="theological-term">capacity for happiness</span> for everything that God wanted to give him.</p>
<p>Remember after the Bathsheba incident what God said to David? And if this had not been enough, I would have given you such and such things. God loved to give to David.</p>
<p>Out of all the people who&rsquo;ve ever lived, there are two people who are outstanding when it comes to God&rsquo;s giving. Paul and David. God could give to them in so many ways and so many wonderful things.</p>
<p>And these men had a marvelous life on this earth, which is more than you&rsquo;re going to be able to say if you don&rsquo;t get with doctrine. Some of you are shaping up to have a horrible, miserable nightmare of a life. Someone may be combing the woods to find a skillful player for you.</p>
<p>Some of you are in bad shape spiritually and you don&rsquo;t even know it. That&rsquo;s the sad thing. Let me tell you something.</p>
<p>Stay with the sheep. What could the sheep be? You could be Baraka.</p>
<p>Stay until you get it. And then we&rsquo;ll all bid you Godspeed as God promotes you into something really great. Now, this same faithfulness in little things is the habit of David&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Being faithful in the little things, he never forgot that while he was with the little things, he received super grace. He received capacity to be blessed of God as few people have ever been blessed. And you know something that David never did?</p>
<p>He never knocked the sheep. He never complained about the sheep. He had a rough time, many times.</p>
<p>And by the way, for those of you who are lonely today, David had lots of loneliness. Can you imagine the only other creatures around? Sheep?</p>
<p>How do you think it would feel to start talking to the sheep? Some goofy-looking you walks up and you say, Hello, honey. You ever been in that bad of shape?</p>
<p>who ever lived because he rejected time and time again, he rejected the superficialities of life. He rejected even details of life because he had enough super-grace moxie to know when something came from God and when it didn&rsquo;t. And by the way, when he finally latched on to something that didn&rsquo;t come from God, not directly anyway, you know, he wouldn&rsquo;t speak to God for a year till God put him down and then he rebounded.</p>
<p>David always knew when something was coming from God and when it wasn&rsquo;t. Now, you put this in your notes. Do I know when something is from God and when it isn&rsquo;t?</p>
<p>Two, if I don&rsquo;t know, how can I learn? Three,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> gives discernment.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I love that phrase in verse 19, with the sheep.</p>
<p>The last phrase in verse 19. Now, hey, you want to see a contrast? You want to rub elbows with reversionism again?</p>
<p>Get this bird. And Jesse took an ass. Jesse was an ass taking an ass.</p>
<p>Loaded it up with Mrs. Baird&rsquo;s best bread. And get this, a bottle of wine, Chateau Lafitte Rothschild, Romani Conti, and a kid, uh-uh, a goat, considered a delicacy in Israel, and sent them by David, his son, to Saul. Get this, if God doesn&rsquo;t promote you, you&rsquo;re not promoted, Jesse.</p>
<p>You idiot. David isn&rsquo;t promoted because you sent a good bottle of wine, a lot of bread, and an animal for the king to eat. It&rsquo;s like trying to bribe a candy merchant with a baby Ruth.</p>
<p>There, you ever notice how everyone&rsquo;s trying to get something with something? Now, Jesse, I don&rsquo;t know if he could afford all this or not. A good bottle of wine, probably in a goat skin, that&rsquo;s the way they had it in those days.</p>
<p>And, uh, he dressed up a goat, a young goat, and all that bread. Bribery, bribery, bribery, bribery. And I can see, Jesse, my boy is now the aide camp of the king.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s because I sent all that bread along with him. That&rsquo;s the way people think. And yet, the secret to David&rsquo;s life should be the secret to your life.</p>
<p>Bible doctrine right here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> in the soul.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Verse 21, And David came to Saul.</p>
<p><span class="hebrew">Cal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Bo</span>. He came because this was the way God wanted it for the moment. <span class="hebrew">Cal</span> imperfect means he came and he stayed.</p>
<p>And stood as the <span class="hebrew">Cal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Amath</span>, which means he began to serve him. See, we studied this recently with Elijah. Elijah said, before the Lord whom I stand.</p>
<p>This means service. And once he begins to serve him, notice that Saul&rsquo;s response to the young David. And he, Saul, loved him greatly.</p>
<p>This is the <span class="hebrew">Cal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Ahab</span>. A-H-A-B-H. The suffix, third masculine singular, refers to David.</p>
<p>Greatly is an adverb to indicate that David was being promoted by the Lord. M-E-O-D-H. <span class="hebrew">Ma-O-D-H</span>.</p>
<p>And he became, <span class="hebrew">Cal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Ha-Yah</span>, his armor bearer. No, no. <span class="hebrew">Ha-A</span>.</p>
<p>No. <span class="hebrew">Cal</span> active participle of <span class="hebrew">Nasas</span>, means to lift up, N-A-S-A-H, plus the word for armor or the military accordaments wrapped around. The word is <span class="hebrew">calim</span>, or weapons.</p>
<p>He became the one who carried his weapons, literally, and it really is an idiom for an aide-a-camp. He became his aide. And in verse 22, this became a permanent arrangement, because Saul requested of Jesse that he be kept on permanently as his aide.</p>
<p>I want you to notice something. An aide-a-camp has military rank. David, for the moment, is taken out of his reserve status and put in the palace of Saul as a young lieutenant.</p>
<p>Now, he won&rsquo;t stay there, but that is the meaning of the calactive participle of <span class="hebrew">Nasas</span>, plus <span class="hebrew">calim</span>. K-E-L-I-M. Means aide-a-camp.</p>
<p>And he&rsquo;s at the moment, he&rsquo;s promoted. Now, listen, Eliab went through military school. Eliab will shortly be with the army as a second lieutenant.</p>
<p>David has two other brothers who are officers in the army. Jesse spent a lot of money getting them trained. David went in a volunteer reserve program, and Jesse never spent a dime on him.</p>
<p>David will be the greatest soldier of his age.</p>
<p>This two brothers in the army will remain professional soldiers, but they will never be promoted. Why?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If God doesn&rsquo;t promote you, you&rsquo;re not promoted.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>And the capacity to carry rank and authority in the military must come from Bible doctrine in the soul. A lot of people can have <span class="theological-term">battle courage</span>, but it&rsquo;s something else to have <span class="theological-term">moral courage</span>. The greatest soldiers we have ever had in our day are Douglas MacArthur and George Patton.</p>
<p>Why? Because both of these men not only had battle courage, which is nothing. What do you have to lose from battle courage?</p>
<p>Your life, that&rsquo;s all. Moral courage, you have the lives of thousands of men depending upon you. And both George Patton and Douglas MacArthur are the only two senior general officers who had moral courage in World War II.</p>
<p>We had some young men like Robert T. Frederick, who became one of the younger major generals of World War II and the most decorated, but those two men stand out. Why? Because in their souls, they were different personalities.</p>
<p>They were as different as black and white. But, both of these men had something that makes a great soldier. Moral courage.</p>
<p>The unwillingness to assume responsibility for thousands of lives and to have steady nerves in making decisions where one slip and thousands of people die. And battle courage is not uncommon or it hasn&rsquo;t been up to now, but</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Moral courage depends on assets of the soul.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A person can have battle courage for the same reason that he could lie and pass a lie detector test.</p>
<p>There are many people they won&rsquo;t give a lie detector test to them. Why? Because the principle doesn&rsquo;t work with them.</p>
<p>Many of the black criminals are in this thing. They don&rsquo;t give them lie detector tests. Why?</p>
<p>Because they could care less. A lie of the truth that&rsquo;s all is saying to them, it&rsquo;s their skin. Their blood pressure just goes right on zip, zip, zip, zip.</p>
<p>It never rises when they lie, like yours would. Now, you can take that same kind of a person, and he&rsquo;s too dumb to know the difference, so he goes out and he&rsquo;s a hero. Battle courage is fairly common, but moral courage is most uncommon.</p>
<p>In fact, that&rsquo;s what God is going to prove sometime tomorrow night in this auditorium. How? He&rsquo;s going to show us through the word of God that while there were many men who had battle courage in the army of Israel, men like Jonathan who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for attacking a fortification all by himself.</p>
<p>single-handedly. That&rsquo;s great courage. Saul had great battle courage, but when the chips are down, it&rsquo;s moral courage that makes a man great in a military situation or in anything else in life.</p>
<p>And moral courage comes through <span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> in the soul. So in verse 22, this became a permanent arrangement. And in verse 23, it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp and played with his hand, so Saul was refreshed.</p>
<p>We know what the evil spirit is. This is mental illness, psychosis, depression, and so on. And please note, it says Saul was refreshed.</p>
<p>The word is <span class="hebrew">Raw whack</span>. R-A-W-A-C-H. <span class="hebrew">Raw whack</span> means to breathe easy.</p>
<p>It means to be relieved of, temporarily, of the mental illness. Here is David already doing a wonderful thing. And what happened?</p>
<p>The depression departed. This is a temporary departure. The word is <span class="hebrew">sewer</span> again, which means dessert.</p>
<p>And therefore, we have at this point David at his first promotional stage. And this is a good place to stop and promote a little rest and relaxation. We&rsquo;re going to stop at this point and we&rsquo;re going to take a 25-minute R&amp;R.</p>
<p>And the refreshments will be served back in the refreshment area behind the glass over this way. And we&rsquo;ll come back at a quarter of half. See, I have a quarter after nine.</p>
<p>Yeah, about a quarter of ten. Twenty minutes of ten. That&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>See you that. Thank you.</p>
