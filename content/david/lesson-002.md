# David Lesson 002

The Word of God is alive and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit of the joints and the marrow, and is a critic of thoughts and intents of the heart.

All scripture is God-breathed and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God might be mature, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.

Study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.

Now in preparation for the study of the Word of God this evening, the next few moments are devoted to silent prayer. The objective is to give you privacy of the priesthood in order that you might <span class="theological-term">rebound</span> if necessary, and in order that you might be <span class="theological-term">filled with the Spirit</span>, which is the only approach to the Word of God.

The Lord once said to Moses, take off your shoes, you stand on holy ground. In this dispensation, it's be filled with the Spirit that you might take in the Word of God.

The only holy ground we have is the canon of Scripture, and it is impossible, no matter how smart you are, even if you're a genius, it's impossible to take in the Word of God. Unless the <span class="theological-term">Holy Spirit</span>, who <span class="theological-term">indwells</span> you, also controls your life.

This can only be accomplished by being in <span class="theological-term">fellowship</span>. This can only be fulfilled by the rebound technique.

And therefore, to give you privacy for preparation for the study of the Word of God, let us pray. (allow a moment for confession)

We are grateful to thee, Heavenly Father, that ours is the privilege of study the Word of God. Every day that we are consistent in taking in the Word, this is just that much closer to the <span class="theological-term">super-grace</span> life and to the <span class="theological-term">capacity for happiness</span> which belongs to the super-grace believer.

Now, Father thank you for that manna from heaven, that bread of life which is so important in our daily walk. to that end, we ask that God the Holy Spirit will sanctify this spiritual food to the nourishment of our souls. Amen.

First Samuel, chapter 16, verse 13. "Then Samuel took the horn of oil".

The horn of oil is the way in which a commission was given in the ancient world. And anointed him, this is David. The word anointed, the word anointed, is the <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">mashach</span>. M-A-S-H-A-C-H. And in the <span class="hebrew">cal</span> stem, this means to commission. And this is God's promise that David will someday be king.

And I want you to notice that David was promoted by the promise of God, but not the reality of experience at the time that he reached <span class="theological-term">super grace</span>.

> **God did not leave David in doubt that someday he would be the king of Israel. But before he reaches that point, there will be many tests, and he will have many opportunities to see the grace of God in action.**

So he anointed him in the midst of his brethren. 

There were seven brothers beside David. All of them had the same opportunity to take in doctrine.

Only one of them made it. Now, here's a family of eight boys. One of them is in super grace.

The rest are non-entities in <span class="theological-term">reversionism</span>. Attractive non-entities, talented non-entities, even smart non-entities, but totally without anything. What makes the difference?

Lest you forget, I want to remind you again and again that

> **<span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> in the soul is the thing that makes the difference.**

All of these boys had the same father and the same mother. All of these boys were brothers, so that they had, within a relative range, the same genes, roughly the same talents and abilities.

All of them, apparently, were very attractive, very handsome. All of them seemed to be reasonably smart, if not very wise. Only one of them ever made it.

Only one of them ever achieved greatness. They all had the same opportunity. They all had the same background.

They all had the same environment. Only one of them ever made it. And that one is David.

Later on, when we study his name, you'll begin to see something as to why. But right now, in anticipation, David was the only one who consistently <span class="theological-term">gapped</span> it to super grace. And at the time of this anointing, David's about 18 years old, and he is a super-grace believer.

He has already arrived at that point. So he was anointed in the midst of his brethren. And then we read, 

The Spirit of the Lord came upon him.

Now, this is actually <span class="hebrew">Ruach Elohim</span>, R-U-A-C-H-E-L-O-H-I-M, the Spirit of <span class="hebrew">Elohim</span>, the Spirit of God. This is a reference to God the Holy Spirit. 

It came upon him, this is the <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> imperfect, from the verb <span class="hebrew">Tsalak</span>.

T-S-A-L-A-C-H, <span class="hebrew">Tsalak</span>. <span class="hebrew">Tsalak</span> means a lot of things, but it means, for example, to pass over. It means to prosper.

Here it means to descend upon, to produce prosperity. God the Holy Spirit descended upon David to produce prosperity. Now, you have to remember that David has been a believer for a long time.

David is a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. He has personally received Christ as his Savior. He has been saved long enough to enter super grace, which means he's probably been saved for at least six or seven or maybe eight or nine years.

He has been consistent in the function of GAP. And this is his first contact, at least the first recorded contact, with God the Holy Spirit. Now, notice the difference.

The moment that you believed in Jesus Christ, God the Holy Spirit <span class="theological-term">indwelt</span> you. God the Holy Spirit made his home in you as of the moment you were saved, and he will never leave. Now, you may be filled with the Spirit in fellowship, or you may <span class="theological-term">grieve the Spirit</span> or <span class="theological-term">quench the Spirit</span>.

But God the Holy Spirit always resides in you. This means there's a difference. And this is the difference.

David lived in the dispensation of Israel, you live in the dispensation of the church, in the dispensation of Israel the ministry of God the Holy Spirit was much different from what it is today. 

The reason being that the Lord Jesus Christ had not come in the flesh, had not gone to the cross, and had not ascended to the right hand of the Father. 

In other words, the Holy Spirit was not yet given because Christ was not yet glorified.

Now, there's a difference here. And here is the principle.

### The Doctrine of the Ministry of the Holy Spirit in the Age of Israel

1. **The Holy Spirit indwelt some Old Testament believers to perform special functions.** But he did not indwelt all believers, or even 90% of believers in any generation.

   **Nine illustrations of the ministry of the Holy Spirit to an Old Testament saint:**

   1. Joseph - Genesis 41:38
   2. The artisans who constructed the tabernacle - Exodus 28:3 and 31:3
   3. The elders or administrators who assisted Moses - Numbers 11:18, 25
   4. Joshua - Numbers 27:18
   5. The judges - For example, Othniel (Judges 3:10), Gideon (Judges 6:4, 34), Jephthah (Judges 11:29), Samson (Judges 13:25; 14:6; 15:14)
   6. Kings of Israel - Saul (1 Samuel 10:9-10), David (1 Samuel 16:13, our passage)
   7. Daniel - Daniel 4:8; 5:11-12, 6:3
   8. Post-exilic rulers - Zechariah 4:3, 12, 14
   9. Old Testament writers - 1 Peter 1:11

   It was very rare for God the Holy Spirit to ever have any ministry to an ordinary believer. 
   
   For example, God the Holy Spirit had no relationship with the father of David, Jesse. He had no relationship with his eldest brother, Eliab. He had no relationship with any of his other brothers. He had no relationship with anyone in David's family, even though they were believers. Only with David. Only special believers.

2. **The believers who had God the Holy Spirit in the Old Testament could be disciplined by the removal of God the Holy Spirit.**

   - The case of Saul - 1 Samuel 16:14 (our next verse)
   - The case of David - Psalm 51:11 (where David prayed that the Holy Spirit would not be taken from him)

3. **Believers of the Old Testament could obtain the Holy Spirit by request.** They could ask for the Holy Spirit (2 Kings 2:9-10; Luke 11:13). Hold the place and turn to Luke 11.

This is one that needs a little explanation due to the fact that some religious have corrupted it. We'll start at Luke 11, 9. 

And I say unto you, Jesus is talking to the disciples.

So they understand that they can have the Holy Spirit on request. He wants them to further understand that they need the Holy Spirit badly because they are Old Testament saints at the moment, and they need to be sustained by the ministry of God the Holy Spirit. So he says, "Ask, and it shall be given you."

This is to ask for the Holy Spirit. Many of you have quoted this as a promise, and really, the principle is there, but you have no right to use this in your prayer promises. You can ask until you overflow and effervesce, but you still aren't going to get what you want under this passage.

Ask, and it shall be given you. Seek, and ye shall find. Knock, and it shall be opened unto you.

Knocking is importunity in prayer. For everyone that asketh receiveth. This is an Old Testament saint.

He that seeketh findeth. To him that knocketh it shall be opened. In other words, Jesus is telling the disciples, You need the Holy Spirit.

And then he illustrates in verse 11, If a son shall ask bread of anyone who is a father, will he give him a stone? Your son is hungry and wants some food. You don't give him a stone to chew on.

Not a normal father, anyway. Or if he asks a fish, will he instead of a fish give him a snake? And the answer is no.

That's ludicrous. So this is illustration by the ludicrous. Or if he shall ask for an egg, even soft boil, once over easy, instead of once over easy, will he put a scorpion on his plate? And the answer is no. 

Now, verse 13, If therefore you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them who ask for him. This was the pattern for the Old Testament.

There were two ways you could get the Holy Spirit as a believer. One, God at some time during your <span class="theological-term">phase two</span> experience sovereignly bestowed the Holy Spirit as he did in the case of David. Or two, certain believers could ask and receive the Holy Spirit.

This was the only way that believers could have a relationship with the Holy Spirit in Old Testament times. 

Now, before you get back, turn to John chapter 20, verse 22 for point four.

John 20:22

4. **Just before the ascension and without their request, since they never did ask, Jesus gave the Holy Spirit to ten of the disciples.** Of course, he didn't give it to Judas Iscariot. He's an unbeliever. Thomas wasn't there, so Thomas didn't get in on it. 

But God the Holy Spirit was given to the disciples minus Thomas to sustain them for fifty days between the resurrection and the day of Pentecost.

John 20:22. And when he had said this, Jesus is speaking, he breathed on them and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit. The Greek word is Pneuma.

Receive ye the Holy Spirit. So God the Holy Spirit was given to ten of the disciples because God knew that the disciples could not last fifty days without divine help.

And therefore, the last fifty days before the age of Israel was interrupted by the church age, God the Holy Spirit was provided for the knuckleheaded disciples.

5. **Once the church age begins, every believer is indwelled by God the Holy Spirit.** Every believer. John 7:37-39; John 14:16-17; 1 Corinthians 3:16; 1 Corinthians 6:19-20. 

Furthermore, every believer in the church age is commanded to be <span class="theological-term">filled with the Spirit</span> (Ephesians 5:18; Galatians 5:16). The rebound technique is the means of fulfilling that command.

6. **In the church age, the believer cannot lose the indwelling Holy Spirit. He can only lose the filling of the Spirit.**

When he loses the filling of the spirit he does so by personal sin. At the point of salvation, every believer enters into union with Christ. That's the top circle. Every believer also enters into fellowship with God in time. This is the place of the filling of the Spirit. When you sin, you're <span class="theological-term">carnal</span>, <span class="theological-term">out of fellowship</span>. When you rebound, you come back under the filling of the Spirit again.

7. **In the previous dispensation (the age of Israel), the Holy Spirit regenerated at the point of salvation. But now, in the church age, God the Holy Spirit accomplishes five things at the point of salvation.**

People were saved in Old Testament times the same way they are saved right now, by believing in Christ. Christ was revealed in a little different manner, because the canon of Scripture was not yet completed, and because the Incarnation had not occurred historically. But, people were still saved the same way. Abraham believed in the Lord, and it was credited to his account for righteousness, Genesis 15:6.

Now, at the point of <span class="theological-term">regeneration</span>, God the Holy Spirit accomplished it for Old Testament saints. He did one thing at the point of salvation for the Old Testament believer. But, he does five of the 36 things in this dispensation.

The first, then, is regeneration, John 3:5, and Titus 3:5.

Secondly, <span class="theological-term">the baptism of the Spirit</span>, Acts 1:5, 1 Corinthians 12:13. That's the ministry whereby God the Holy Spirit enters every believer into union with Christ. And it is, in contrast, to regeneration, whereby God the Holy Spirit causes us to be born into the family of God. So we're all born into the family of God the same way, the ministry of the Spirit.

The third thing God does, the God the Holy Spirit does, is to stamp us with a seal. We are sealed by the ministry of the Spirit, 2 Corinthians 1:22, Ephesians 1:13, and 4:30. This guarantees <span class="theological-term">eternal security</span>.

4. He sovereignly and graciously bestows upon every believer at least one <span class="theological-term">spiritual gift</span>. 1 Corinthians 12:12 and 13. One spiritual gift for every believer.

And 5. He indwells every believer at the point of salvation, Romans 8:9, 1 Corinthians 3:16, 1 Corinthians 6:19 and 20, Galatians 3:2.

8. **In John 7:39, we have a principle: The Holy Spirit was not yet given because Christ was not yet glorified.**

In John chapter 20, verse 22, the Holy Spirit was given under the conditions specified for Old Testament saints. Therefore, the ministry of the Holy Spirit for the 50 days before Pentecost was an Old Testament ministry.

All right. Verse 14. 1 Samuel 6:14.

David did not ask for the Holy Spirit. David did not solicit the ministry of the Holy Spirit. God the Holy Spirit sovereignly came to help David at the point of his anointing. 

From that time on, David was pinpointed in the <span class="theological-term">angelic conflict</span>. 

David was to be the key for the whole <span class="theological-term">Davidic covenant</span>, for the <span class="theological-term">Messianic line</span>, and therefore God the Holy Spirit will act as his protector in the spiritual conflict and will empower and endue him for the conflicts which he must face on earth. 

But remember that the primary source of power for any Old Testament saint was the Bible doctrine content in his soul.

1 Samuel 16:14. But the Spirit of the Lord, <span class="hebrew">Ruach Adonai</span>, R-U-A-C-H, Jehovah. 

This is a reference again to God the Holy Spirit. <span class="hebrew">Ruach Adonai</span> refers to the Holy Spirit whose ministry in the previous dispensation was specialized, and therefore, as part of reversionistic discipline, the Spirit was removed from Saul.

So the Holy Spirit departed. The Qal perfect of <span class="hebrew">suwr</span>, <span class="hebrew">suwr</span> usually means to desert, desert. Here it just means to be removed. And this was a permanent thing.

Saul is now officially in <span class="theological-term">reversionism</span>. For him to get there, Saul had to go negative toward Bible doctrine. That's taught in 1 Chronicles 10:13 and 14. 

Then he had to get <span class="theological-term">scar tissue</span> on the left bank of his soul. And then he had to begin a frantic search for happiness which put scar tissue on the right bank of his soul. And then he had <span class="theological-term">emotional revolt</span> of the soul, and at the same time the attack of <span class="theological-term">Mataiotes</span>. This is why he has <span class="theological-term">demon influence</span> in his life. King Saul was a believer under demon influence.

And then, after emotional revolt, he began to practice reverse process reversionism. And while at this stage he is a mental attitude reversionist, before this chapter is over, he has his first attack of manic depressive, and he becomes a psychotic, a periodic <span class="theological-term">psychotic reversionism</span>.

Most people who become psychotic always do so by way of <span class="theological-term">mental attitude sins</span>. Jealousy, bitterness, vindictiveness, implacability, hatred, guilt complex. 

Many people crack up with guilt complex. 

No one ever simply jumped into a psychotic condition, not unless they had it inherently. Most people become psychotic. They acquire that condition of mental illness, and they do so, first of all, by mental attitude sins in the soul.

At this point, David is commissioned king of Israel, and eventually he will arrive there. The promise is given through the anointing. Many times David will have to remember this anointing. Many times this anointing will be a temptation to cut some corners. But David always waited on the Lord.

David is one of the greatest believers of all time. He had the capacity. He had the doctrine. He knew that God could give as no one could ever give. He understood something of the character of God, something of God's capacity to give, something of God's ability to give, and therefore always David came back to this.

In other words, David as a born-again believer had so much information on the essence box that he didn't need promises like you often need promises. In fact, he cooked up some of the promises in the Psalms and elsewhere. Why? Because David as a super-grace believer was occupied with the person of Christ.

There is only one celebrity for believers in any dispensation. There are many super-grace heroes, but one celebrity, and that one celebrity is the Lord Jesus Christ. And David was completely occupied with the person of Christ, and therefore many times he demonstrated how he could wait on the Lord.

He was promoted in a wonderful way in Saul's court. He went back to the sheep. Many, many times he could have gone the human viewpoint route, and he could have achieved some fame. But David took the attitude, if God doesn't promote you, you're not promoted. 

And many times when David could have advanced himself, he refused to do so. He would stop and say, if God doesn't provide it for me, I don't want it. When God provides it, it's permanent and it's wonderful and I have the capacity for it. But if God doesn't provide it, it's not worth it. And therefore I will wait until God provides it.

And God is fair and God is righteous and God has never let one believer down and God has provided things for me in eternity past that I know not of as yet. But I will know these things. I will wait for these things.

Now you can't say that tonight unless you have achieved super grace. 

You must have <span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> in your soul. That's the thing that really counts.

And until you get doctrine in your soul, don't try to con God. Just keep on calling God names. Just keep right on using him as a patsy.

Keep on saying to God, why did you let this happen to me? Because you're a jackass and you might as well be honest about it and keep blaspheming until you get enough doctrine to come out of the woods and straighten up. 

Now in verse 14 again, but the spirit of the Lord, the Holy Spirit departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.

I don't want to spend too much time here, but I think you should understand this evil spirit. It's <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span>, <span class="hebrew">Ra'ah</span>, the Hebrew. Let's start with the Hebrew.

Now let's get, here, there it is, R-U-A-C-H R-A-A-H. <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span>, <span class="hebrew">Ra'ah</span>. <span class="hebrew">Ra'ah</span> is the noun here for evil.

Now <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span> means breath, life, inspiration, spirit. We have just seen <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span> used for a title for the Holy Spirit, but that's the only way it becomes a title for the Holy Spirit. <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span> must be with either the <span class="hebrew">Tetragrammaton</span> or occasionally you will find <span class="hebrew">Elohim</span>, but generally when it's <span class="hebrew">Elohim</span> it means from God rather than of God.

It isn't God in other words, it's something distinct from God. So we have <span class="hebrew">Ruach</span>, <span class="hebrew">Ra'ah</span>, referring to, get this now, not a person, not even a demon, but inward depression, melancholy, leading to psychosis. In other words, when Saul went into reversionism, he began to become depressed, he began to be melancholy, he was filled with self-pity, and eventually his reversionism led him to psychosis.

Now we have to remember once again there are three phases to reversionistic discipline. 

The first is the phase where God knocks on the door, so we'll call that the knocking phase. Behold, I stand at the door and knock.

That's discipline from God as a warning that reversionism is here, and it's a warning to rebound and to get back with Bible doctrine. 

The second phase is intensity. The intensity stage, that's the one where you're psycho.

Here we have mental attitude sins. This is Saul. When you go from that, that's the warning stage.

That's self-induced misery and everything else that's produced along with it. But when you get to the psycho stage or the psychopathic stage sometimes, then you get intensity. 

And then finally there is the dying stage, <span class="theological-term">the sin unto death</span>.

The Intensity stage requires repentance, the dying under the sin unto death stage requires repentance, and both of them require getting back to authority. 

We saw this under James 5. 

The knocking stage requires rebound and back to doctrine.

Actually, <span class="hebrew">ruach ra'ah</span> is the first stage, the warning stage. 

The word trouble also helps us to understand that this is not a demon, this is not a person, this is a state of the soul. 

<span class="hebrew">Ruach</span> indicates that which is invisible but real, therefore something in the soul.

Therefore, it is sometimes inspiration, sometimes breath, sometimes even life. 

But here, the evil spirit refers to the inward depression which characterizes the first stage of reversionistic discipline. 

The word trouble is the <span class="hebrew">Piel</span> perfect of <span class="hebrew">Ba'at</span>.

Looks like this. B-A-A-T. <span class="hebrew">Ba'at</span>, in the <span class="hebrew">Piel</span> stem, of course, is a very intense stem.

In the Qal stem, for example, <span class="hebrew">Ba'at</span> would mean to be frightened. But in the <span class="hebrew">Piel</span> stem, it means to be totally, completely terrified, to bereft of the ability to think, and therefore to be terrified.

so literally it should be translated, The spirit of the Lord, the Holy Spirit, departed from Saul. There is the beginning of discipline for reversionism. While a spirit of evil discipline from the Lord, it was evil to Saul, but anything from the Lord is not evil.

It means evil discipline. Terrified him. In other words, he began to have serious mental aberrations which are indicative of the beginning of a psychotic condition.

He was mentally ill. And as a result of that, in verses 15, we see his problem recognized. In verse 16, we see the solution sought.

In verse 17, we have Saul agreeing to some therapy. Let's notice one or two things in passing here. 

Saul's servants do not mean his servants, like you use the word servant.

These are people high in his government. It could be his secretary of state or his chief of staff. It could be any one of these people.

These are high-ranking officers in his government. And Saul's officers said to him, Behold now, you have trouble in the soul. Evil spirit is used here for mental illness from God indicates this is divine discipline.

And again, we have the word trouble, <span class="hebrew">ba'at</span> again in the <span class="hebrew">Piel</span> stem, to terrify you. 

Let our Lord now command thy servants, the officers, before you, to find someone to help you, to seek out a man who is, get this, now this is their suggestion, musical therapy.

Not a cunning player, we don't need any cunning types around, this is skillful. A skillful player on a harp. I want you to please note, some of you, no rock music, no drums.

A player on a harp. This is the great-great grandfather of the piano. They just turned it sideways and called it a harpsichord and eventually became a piano.

And it shall come to pass when the mental illness from the Lord is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be well. Actually, it's his hands. He didn't play with one hand, he played with both.

And thou shalt be well. And Saul said to his officers, provide me. This is <span class="hebrew">ra-ah</span> again, <span class="hebrew">Qal</span>, imperative of that word we had this morning so many times, r-a-a-h, and it means look for someone for me, a man that can play well and bring him to me.

All right, this introduces now a man for a crisis, a super-grace type. 1 Samuel 16, verses 18 through 23. Then answered one of the officers in the government and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse.

Here it is, the <span class="hebrew">Qal</span>, perfect, of <span class="hebrew">raah</span>, r-a-a-h. This means to observe, I have observed a son of Jesse. When God promotes a man, people are going to discover him at just the right moment.

If God doesn't promote, then he will play to the sheep. Where did David learn to play this harp, this musical instrument? He learned that with the sheep, at night, when the wolves and the animals, various types of predatory animals, lions, bears, are hovering near the flock and looking for an opportunity to snatch a quick dinner, the sheep sense these predatory animals and are frightened.

And so David would sit in the midst of his flock and he'd play to them and this would calm them down. This is the way shepherds have operated for thousands of years. So he was skilled on a musical instrument.

I have seen a skillful, the word cunning, by the way, is a Qal active participle of a verb with which you're familiar from the days of Psalm 119. <span class="hebrew">Yadah</span> means to know. The Qal active participle means to keep on knowing, to know well, and therefore a skillful player.

Now I want you to notice the next thing very carefully. The Jews had a reserve system and they had a system for training young men for military. And David had taken some military training.

He would take time off each summer and go to summer camp and take some training. I want you to notice what it says about him. He is said to be a mighty, valiant man.

Now in the Hebrew, this is <span class="hebrew">Givor Chajil</span>. Looks like this.

<span class="hebrew">Givor Chajil</span> means someone who has successfully gone through his training. It's translated a mighty, valiant man. But it actually means a man who is well prepared.

Today, this would be something like maybe an airborne ranger. He's passed all of the tough things. Or in a pathfinder.

Or someone who's really been through something tough. In something where he had proved himself.

In other words, David wore a patch. And the patch said <span class="hebrew">givor chajil</span>. When he put on his uniform, he had a patch.

And that means he's tough, trained, well versed in how to kill people. So he could pull a string off his piano, his harp, and he could throttle someone with it. He knew all the ways to kill people with his bare hands.

And every born-again believer ought to know these things. I know I've also read the Sermon on the Mount. The Sermon on the Mount is for the millennium.

Not for today. Not even close. The Sermon on the Mount was Jesus presenting a platform for the millennium.

And when the swords are turned into plowshares and the spears into pruning hooks, the citizens of the millennium can turn the other cheek. The only way to turn the other cheek now is to roll with a punch and come up with a counterpunch. Usually if you turn the other cheek, you roll and you bend your elbow and hook.

And that's the only turning of the other cheek for the church age and the tribulation. So get that nonsense out of your head. That belongs to the libs, the bleeding hearts, the national council of churches, and all of the other religious apostates and reversionists of this world.

It's a part of communist propaganda today. But it doesn't belong to you as a believer in Jesus Christ. Now David had never been to war.

David had just been in training. And all this means here, <span class="hebrew">Givor Chajil</span>, is that he had been well trained in certain facets of military life and had passed well. And so he's called a man of war, <span class="hebrew">Ishmil Chamah</span>, I-S-H-M-I-L C-H-A-M-A-H.

<span class="hebrew">Ish mil Chamah</span> simply means that he was a well-trained reservist and could be called up. By the way, he never was called up except by God at the right time. But he has had military training.

Now God the Holy Spirit put this in at this point. He's not going to use the ordinary accoutrements of warfare. That's why I'm sure he went through ranger school because they considered an insult to have to kill somebody with a conventional type way.

They can do it other ways that are much better. Very neat. And a lot of satisfaction out of strangling someone with a piece of piano wire or using a short dirk of some kind or breaking someone's back by just the right movement at the right time.

Just snap his backbone and step on his communist face and march on. So David is trained in these things. He is not trained in conventional weapons.

But he is trained to fight. And by the way, God the Holy Spirit put this in here. And also this is a reminder to any of you so-called conscientious objectors, you yellow-bellied cowards who don't understand Bible doctrine and wouldn't fight for your country.

All right, I have seen a skillful musician. But that isn't all. You can bring him into the court.

Apparently, the person who made the recommendation was an undersecretary of the Department of Defense. The reason is because he knows something about David. And the reason he knows something about David is because when David went off for training, reserve training, when at night in the barracks, he'd play. And apparently, this guy made an inspection and heard David play.

So he's impressed with David. He says, David already has graduated from certain of our schools where he is already an official soldier. He's an <span class="hebrew">Ish mil</span>, <span class="hebrew">Chamah</span>.

He is also <span class="hebrew">givor</span>, <span class="hebrew">chajil</span>. And that isn't all he can play very well the instrument. 

This undersecretary from the department of defense, has another thing to say.

He says he is prudent in matters. Now, what do you suppose he means by prudent in matters? Well, we have <span class="hebrew">Nebon Dabar</span>.

Let's find out what this is all about by starting with the original. N-E-B-O-N, pronounced <span class="hebrew">Nebon</span>. D-A-B-A-R, pronounced <span class="hebrew">Dabar</span>.

<span class="hebrew">Nebon Dabar</span>. What is a <span class="hebrew">Nebon Dabar</span>? It means a person who has unusually learned in doctrine, constantly perceiving doctrine.

You see, <span class="hebrew">Nebon</span> is the <span class="hebrew">Nifel</span> participle of <span class="hebrew">Bin</span>, which we've also had before. Bin is one of the verbs for perception of Bible doctrine. And in the <span class="hebrew">Nifel</span> stem, it can be either passive or reflexive.

Here it's reflexive. This person himself has learned a lot of doctrine. Now, I want you to notice the things that were noted.

**An undersecretary from the Department of Defense has said:**

1. He's skillful as a musician
2. He is <span class="hebrew">Givor Chajil</span> - a mighty, valiant man who has gone through the toughest schools
3. He is <span class="hebrew">Ish-Mil-Kamah</span> - a man of war, qualified as a soldier
4. He is strong for Bible doctrine
5. He is a comely person - <span class="hebrew">Ish-Toh-Ar</span> (I-S-H T-O A-R). <span class="hebrew">To-Er</span> really means handsome in appearance. So he is a man handsome in appearance
6. **The Lord is with him** - this is the Super-Grace Hero!

<span class="hebrew">Adonai-Emole</span>. All right. Corrected translation.

Then one of the staff answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem, skillful in playing a musical instrument, a hero of great valor, that's his patch, a professional soldier, that's his training, constantly learning doctrine, that's his life, a man of handsome appearance, that's his inheritance from his father and mother. Moreover, the Lord is with him. That's super-grace.

Whatever else could be said about you, two of these things can belong to you any time you decide to go that way. Constantly learning doctrine and the Lord with you. Now, verse 19.

Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, Send me David thy son, who is with the sheep, how did they know that? They read his personnel file. They had a whole file on him.

All they went to the department of defense and just checked his file. They found out that he was working with the sheep. Now, that with the sheep is important.

David was faithful in the little things. Let's review what he has in verse 18. First of all, he's skillful with a musical instrument.

He's a good musician. Secondly, he has graduated from the toughest military schools. Thirdly, he is a professional soldier.

Fourthly, he is constantly learning doctrine. Four, he's handsome in appearance, and the Lord is with him. Now, all of these things add up.

You would think by now he would probably have a desk up in one of the more secret offices in the military. You would think perhaps he'd at least be the recruiting officer in Bethlehem. But he is none of these things.

Why? He is waiting on the Lord.

> **If the Lord doesn't promote you, you're not promoted.**

If the Lord doesn't give it to you, you don't have it. Now, that's important. Once again, verse 18.

Then one of the staff answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse. that's his family relationship of Bethlehem. That's his hometown. 

Skillful in playing. He's a musician. A hero of great valor. That's his special patch.

A professional soldier. He's completed his military training. He's a reservist.

He's constantly learning doctrine. Super grace. A man of handsome appearance.

That's from the inheritance from his family. The Lord is with him. Super grace function.

And what's he doing? He's with the sheep. You notice something strange there?

David, with all of these things going for him, is not pushing David. Did you ever see someone who was ambitious and pushy? Every now and then you run into some guy who's really ambitious and he wants to be a great preacher and he wants to cut a wide swath down through fundamentalism and he's already taping his own messages and sending them to his mother.

And it's just fantastic how some of these birds operate. They're real pushy. And that isn't all.

They're depending upon someone to help push. So they hook up with the denomination. So they hook up with some seminary.

They try to get some seminary president to recommend them here and there. They have to have someone to sponsor them. I want you to notice something, all of you who are sponsor conscious.

Who sponsored David? I'll tell you who didn't. That's his father, Jesse.

Jesse spent all of his money putting seven sons through school. But David mocks Nix. Nothing for David.

David just kept the sheep. David, you keep working on the sheep till we get all of your fine brothers through school. And maybe there will be something left over for you.

No one pushes David, not even his father, Jesse, which all goes to prove that Jesse was a dope, too. He was a real dodo. Jesse, in fact, you're going to see how stupid he was, a leader in reversionism.

Every time we see Jesse, he's either bribing a battalion commander to promote Eliab, or he's sending a present to the king so that he will do something special for one of his sons. 

Every time you see Jesse, Jesse reminds me of a fond mother who's always writing her congressman to get her boy ahead or to make sure that his cookies are delivered to the barracks, special delivery, preferably by the company commander. Jesse's an ass.

He doesn't understand a basic thing in life. Why? Because he's reversionistic himself.

You know, don't you get a little creepy once in a while going through this passage? Everywhere you turn, you run into a reversionist. Saul's psychotic.

Jesse's trying to bribe a psycho to help his sons. Eliab thinks he's important and is so taken with his importance that he'll have a sneer or two in the next chapter. Just think we're going to give Eliab a line.

This big, tall, handsome jackass actually talks. Believe it or not, he'll talk in the next lesson. Oh, it's tragic to see this unfold.

Samuel weeping for Saul, who's a psycho. Everywhere you turn, you have reversionism. What a horrible place to be.

Let me tell you something our nations, for the first time in its history, has become a horrible place to be. Why?

Because everywhere you turn, it's reversionism, reversionism, reversionism. Everything that's said. How many times have your employers, many of you who work for someone, they want you to grow sideburns and long hair, because that's the in thing of all the jackass things.

Here you are, you can do a fabulous job for someone, and all they're worried about is how you look. Everywhere you turn, there's one outfit that just makes me sick. They're always catering to the communists anyway, and they make all of the people in their company wear little old tiny strings for ties.

What those strings are good for is to strangle them in a fight. The worst thing I've ever seen. Everywhere you turn, somebody's got some human viewpoint gimmick.

it's the most awful thing in the world. It's reversionism. And that's what we're seeing.

And it's very refreshing to see this one person who just wades through all of this stuff. He stays with the sheep until God promotes him. And even when God appears to promote him at one stage, he knows it's not a true promotion.

And you know what he does? He goes right back to the sheep. All right, this little phrase in verse 19, with the sheep.

Here's the principle behind it. David was faithful in the little things. You put that down.

> **Faithfulness in the little things is much more important than being some kind of a big shot.**

Faithfulness in the little things is better than having your <span class="theological-term">approbation lust</span> stimulated. 

Have you ever stopped to think, who calls the shots for being famous today?

Huh? Let's take football. Who's famous in football?

Who calls the shots? The people call the shots in football. So here's one kind of fame where it depends upon what a lot of people think.

So we'll call this hoi polloi fame. All right, how would you like to have hoi polloi fame? You know there are people around who have hoi polloi fame.

There are a lot of professional football players they have hoi polloi fame. Why?

Because it's given to them by people. They do something well, people think they're great. They do two things well, people think they're super great.

So they're superstars, or they're stars, or they're great, or they're wonderful, or they're fine. And who says so? The general public says so.

That's what they say today. And so, football stars, if God hasn't promoted you, where are you tomorrow? Boo!

That's where you are tomorrow. And so what kind of fame is that? It's no fame at all.

Then, let's say you have another kind of fame, where you're in some, this is called business fame. You're in a business organization, and you're well thought of, and so people say, well, you stick around, we're going to use you, we're going to make you an executive, we're going to do this and that for you, we're going to promote you. And so after you lick some guy's shoes for 10 years, you get promoted to junior sub, vice sub, junior president, in charge of janitorial supplies for e-building left wing.

Aren't you lucky? Oh, you really worked hard, too. Why you have so much shoe polish on your tongue, you can't even say, thank you, sir.

Who's calling the shots? By the way, who's calling the shots in Christendom today? Who's a great preacher?

Who's a great evangelist? Who's a great anything? A bunch of fundy idiots.

They have no concept of Bible doctrine. 

If God doesn't promote you, you just aren't promoted. 

Some of you had a lonely day today, probably wished you were married for the first time in six months.

Four walls. I'll do you one bit of that. I once had four walls and a roach going up.

There are a lot of married people that would have traded places with you. See, this is one of those big family days when the have-nots wish they had and the haves wish they had not.

Stuffed turkey. Let me tell you something. So you don't have a <span class="theological-term">right woman</span>.

There's something worse. You could have the wrong woman. You don't have the <span class="theological-term">right man</span>, huh?

Something worse. You could have the wrong man.

In an organization, you surrender a certain amount of freedom. Those of you in single bliss, you have 100% freedom. The moment you join that organization called marriage, you lose some of it.

Freedom's a valuable thing. And yet you never lose freedom where it's right man or right woman. You only gain.

So, if God promotes you, fine. If he doesn't, stay away from it.

> **If God doesn't give it to you, it's not worth having.**

If God does give it to you, latch on. You've got something wonderful. And stay with doctrine so you can appreciate it.

But remember this, too. When God gives you something, he also demands responsibility for upkeep and proper use of. 

With the sheep.

All right. Get this now. Put it in your notes.

Every believer has his flock of sheep. Everyone has an area of relatively unpleasant circumstances where he's waiting. Are you willing to go to <span class="theological-term">super grace</span> first with your flock of sheep and then let the Lord introduce you to society or not?

That's where most believers miss the boat. They are not willing to <span class="theological-term">GAP</span> it to super grace and then let the Lord promote them from a flock of sheep to something else. They want: Now Lord! I want it now! not tomorrow or the next day.

The rapture may occur the third day. I want it now.

You're out of line completely and totally. The only way you'll ever be happy with a flock of sheep is to take in <span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> every day. 

While David was with the sheep, he was prepared in many ways.

He became a great musician. He became, he had the best military training that Israel could provide. He had <span class="theological-term">capacity for happiness</span> and for everything that God wanted to give him.

Remember after the Bathsheba incident what God said to David? And if this had not been enough, I would have given you such and such things. God loved to give to David.

Out of all the people who've ever lived, there are two people who are outstanding when it comes to God's giving. 

Paul and David. 

God could give to them in so many ways and so many wonderful things.

And these men had a marvelous life on this earth, which is more than you're going to be able to say if you don't get with doctrine. 

Some of you are shaping up to have a horrible, miserable nightmare of a life. Someone may be combing the woods to find a skillful player for you.

Some of you are in bad shape spiritually and you don't even know it. That's the sad thing. Let me tell you something.

Stay with the sheep. What could the sheep be? it could be your church.

Stay until you get it. And then we'll all bid you Godspeed as God promotes you into something really great. 

This same faithfulness in little things is the habit of David's life.

Being faithful in the little things, he never forgot that while he was with the little things, he received super grace. He received capacity to be blessed of God as few people have ever been blessed. And you know something that David never did?

He never knocked the sheep. He never complained about the sheep. He had a rough time, many times.

And by the way, for those of you who are lonely today, David had lots of loneliness. Can you imagine the only other creatures around? Sheep?

David stayed with the Sheep. Why? 

Because David had a very clear perception of Phase 2. He knew that the only thing that counted in phase 2 outside of doctrine is what God gave him and that nothing else was worth it, that it was a sham, it was superficial, that it would only bring unhappiness, and misery, not blessing.

And David was one of the smartest people who ever lived because he rejected time and time again, he rejected the superficialities of life. 

He rejected even details of life because he had enough super-grace moxie to know when something came from God and when it didn't. 

And by the way, when he finally latched on to something that didn't come from God, not directly anyway, you know, he wouldn't speak to God for a year till God put him down and then he rebounded.

David always knew when something was coming from God and when it wasn't. Now, you put this in your notes. 

1) Do I know when something is from God and when it isn't?

2) if I don't know, how can I learn?

3) 

> **<span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> gives discernment.**

I love that phrase in verse 19: with the sheep.

The last phrase in verse 19. 

Now, hey, you want to see a contrast? 

You want to rub elbows with reversionism again?

Get this bird. And Jesse took an ass. Jesse was an ass taking an ass.

And get this, a bottle of wine, Chateau Lafitte Rothschild, Romani Conti, and a goat, considered a delicacy in Israel, and sent them by David, his son, to Saul. Get this, if God doesn't promote you, you're not promoted, Jesse.

David isn't promoted because you sent a good bottle of wine, a lot of bread, and an animal for the king to eat.

There, you ever notice how everyone's trying to get something with something? 

Now, Jesse, I don't know if he could afford all this or not. A good bottle of wine, probably in a goat skin, that's the way they had it in those days.

And, uh, he dressed up a goat, a young goat, and all that bread. Bribery, bribery, bribery, bribery. And I can see, Jesse, my boy is now the aide camp of the king.

It's because I sent all that bread along with him. That's the way people think. 

And yet, the secret to David's life should be the secret to your life.

Bible doctrine in the heart.

> **<span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> in the soul.**

Verse 21, And David came to Saul.

<span class="hebrew">Qal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Bo</span>. He came because this was the way God wanted it for the moment. <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> imperfect means he came and he stayed.

And stood as the <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Amath</span>, which means he began to serve him. See, we studied this recently with Elijah. Elijah said, before the Lord whom I stand.

This means service. And once he begins to serve him, notice that Saul's response to the young David. And he, Saul, loved him, (David) greatly.

This is the <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Ahab</span>. A-H-A-B-H. The suffix, third masculine singular, refers to David.

Greatly is an adverb to indicate that David was being promoted by the Lord. M-E-O-D-H. <span class="hebrew">M-E-O-D-H</span>.

And he became, <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Ha-Yah</span>, his armor bearer. No, no. <span class="hebrew">Ha-Yah</span>.

No. <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> active participle of <span class="hebrew">Nasah</span>, means to lift up, N-A-S-A-H, plus the word for armor or the military accoutrements wrapped around. The word is <span class="hebrew">calim</span>, or weapons.

He became the one who carried his weapons, literally, and it really is an idiom for an aide-a-camp. He became his aide. And in verse 22, this became a permanent arrangement, because Saul requested of Jesse that he be kept on permanently as his aide.

I want you to notice something. An aide-a-camp has military rank. David, for the moment, is taken out of his reserve status and put in the palace of Saul as a young lieutenant.

Now, he won't stay there, but that is the meaning of the Qal active participle of <span class="hebrew">Nasah</span>, plus <span class="hebrew">Kelim</span>. K-E-L-I-M. Means aide-a-camp.

And he's at the moment, he's promoted. 

Now, listen, Eliab went through military school. Eliab will shortly be with the army as a second lieutenant.

David has two other brothers who are officers in the army. Jesse spent a lot of money getting them trained. 

David went in a volunteer reserve program, and Jesse never spent a dime on him.

David will be the greatest soldier of his age.

Eliab and his two brothers in the army will remain professional soldiers, but they will never be promoted. Why?

> **If God doesn't promote you, you're not promoted.**

And the capacity to carry rank and authority in the military must come from Bible doctrine in the soul. A lot of people can have <span class="theological-term">battle courage</span>, but it's something else to have <span class="theological-term">moral courage</span>. The greatest soldiers we have ever had in our day are Douglas MacArthur and George Patton.

Why? Because both of these men not only had battle courage, which is nothing. What do you have to lose from battle courage?

Your life, that's all. Moral courage, you have the lives of thousands of men depending upon you. And both George Patton and Douglas MacArthur are the only two senior general officers who had moral courage in World War II.

We had some young men like Robert T. Frederick, who became one of the younger major generals of World War II and the most decorated, but those two men stand out. Why? Because in their souls, they were different personalities.

They were as different as black and white. But, both of these men had something that makes a great soldier. Moral courage.

The unwillingness to assume responsibility for thousands of lives and to have steady nerves in making decisions where one slip and thousands of people die. And battle courage is not uncommon or it hasn't been up to now, but

> **Moral courage depends on assets of the soul.**

Battle courage is fairly common, but moral courage is most uncommon.

In fact, that's what God is going to prove sometime tomorrow night in the next lesson. How? 

He's going to show us through the word of God that while there were many men who had battle courage in the army of Israel, men like Jonathan who won the Congressional Medal of Honor for attacking a fortification all by himself.

single-handedly. That's great courage. Saul had great battle courage, but when the chips are down, it's moral courage that makes a man great in a military situation or in anything else in life.

And moral courage comes through <span class="theological-term">Bible doctrine</span> in the soul. 

So in verse 22, this became a permanent arrangement. 

And in verse 23, it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp and played with his hand, so Saul was refreshed.

We know what the evil spirit is. This is mental illness, psychosis, depression, and so on. And please note, it says Saul was refreshed.

The word is <span class="hebrew">Rawach</span>. R-A-W-A-C-H. <span class="hebrew">Rawach</span> means to breathe easy.

It means to be relieved of, temporarily, of the mental illness. Here is David already doing a wonderful thing. And what happened?

The depression departed. This is a temporary departure. The word is <span class="hebrew">sewer</span> again, which means dessert.

And therefore, we have at this point David at his first promotional stage. 

Thank you father for the privilege of studying these things may God the holy spirit make it a challenge to our lives for we ask it in Christ's name, Amen.
