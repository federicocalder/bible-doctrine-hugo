# David Lesson 001

Open the Word of God once again to 1 Samuel, chapter 17.
1 Samuel, chapter 17.
Reviewing the translation of verse 26 and moving on.
1 Samuel 17, verse 26.
All right, the translation says,

Now, this passage states the attitude of the super-graced believer.
As one who is prepared in his soul, he understands every principle of doctrine, from the celebrity-ship of Jesus Christ to the importance of the military establishment and the freedom of a national entity.
There is no gap in his doctrinal concepts.
He speaks with confidence.

The daily intake of doctrine over a long period of time. He states several things in verse 26 by way of review. First of all, the certainty that the Goliath can be killed in combat. Secondly, the fact that the giant has been able to intimidate an entire army for 40 days is a disgrace to the military arms of the nation. And especially since the army of Israel is the army of the living God, and the commander-in-chief is the Lord of the armies, called here the Lord of hosts. David states his intention of killing Goliath himself.

David considers the 40-day elapse, without anyone accepting the challenge, as dishonor to the military establishment of Israel. And therefore, he intends to do something about it. Before he does, I think it is apropos to notice the category of doctrine, which is pertinent throughout the rest of this chapter. This is the doctrine of the military establishment. The doctrine of the military establishment. The timing of this conference is excellent.

We are Christ. Those who have administered the communion are those who are military types. We would not be free for any type of worship were it not for the fact that in the history of our nation, the military has been successful on many battlefields, and many men wearing the uniform of this country have died so that even yellow hippies can have freedom. And the freedoms which we enjoy and the freedoms which we possess belong to us on the basis of the laws of divine establishment.

Establishment.
Point one.
The military establishment is designed under the laws of God to protect a national entity,
to first of all gain its freedom, to protect its freedom, its laws,
and all other establishments.
The military is the guardian of establishment in a national entity.
This principle is brought out in Nehemiah chapter 4, verses 14 and 15.
Nehemiah chapter 4, verses 14 and 15.
This is a very important passage because it clarifies the role of the believer in the military.

ng,
I inspected, and I rose up and spoke to the generals, to the officers, and to the rank and file of the army.
That's a literal translation.
Be not afraid of them, the enemies who surround it.
Remember the Lord, a great and mighty warrior.
The Lord Jesus Christ holds the record for killing the enemy in one battle.
He has killed 185,000 of the best infantry in the world in just one second.
However, he will break his own record at the second advent,
where he will kill literally millions of people by the word of his mouth in a few seconds.

Him. Recall the Lord. That's what we have been doing this evening, remembering the Lord in connection with the cross. Military men are told to remember the Lord in connection with his fighting ability. Great and terrible, or great and mighty warrior. Now, when you face the enemy, this is what you do. Fight for your brethren. That's divine institution number four, your national entity. Your sons and daughters. Divine institution number three, the family. Your wives. Divine institution number two.

And your houses. Divine institution number one, with emphasis on the right to possess property and to have privacy under the concept of that property. So these are the things for which you fight. These are the things for which the enemy should always be killed. Never coddled. Killed. One of the signs of reversionism in King Saul was the fact that he refused to kill the enemy.

Point two. In spite of man's efforts for peace, warfare will continue until the millennium. Matthew 24:6. Mark 13:7. Luke 21:9.

For history.
Three, Ecclesiastes 3, 8 and Numbers 21, 14.
But necessary for the maintenance of national sovereignty and freedom.
Three.
In both the struggle for and perpetuation of Jewish freedom after the Exodus, Jesus Christ himself became the commander-in-chief of the armies of Israel. Adonai Tzabaoth is his title. Jesus Christ was the commander-in-chief, and Joshua discovered that he was only the chief of staff. Joshua 5, 13 through chapter 6, verse 2.
Four.
Armies defend freedom.
Other armies destroy freedom.

Freedom against the Philistines. The Philistines fought to enslave the Jews. So the Jewish army was fighting to defend their freedom, whereas the Philistine army was fighting to enslave them. This concept is found throughout the Scripture, Jeremiah, chapter 34, verse 7.

Point 5.
The issue of national sovereignty, integrity, and freedom depends on which army wins.
Sixth, the victory of David over Goliath means that the Jews will maintain their freedom.
Sixth, God uses the military in action to demonstrate the degeneracy or reversionism of a nation.

What Goliath could stand for 40 days and challenge someone to combat, and no one took him up, was indicative of the reversionism in the ranks of Israel and among the people in general. And no hippie today would ever have taken up the challenge either. Seven. Since the battlefield decides freedom, universal military training is an important function in any national entity under God. Luke 14, 31, numbers 31, 3 through 5. Eight. Military leadership is an index of national character. Proverbs 24, says Proverbs 24, 1 through 6.

Proverbs 24, verses 1 through 6.
Lack of military leadership is an index of national character. That means lack of character in the entire nation. But the presence of good military leadership is an index of good and strong national character. Proverbs 24, verse 1 says, "Stop being jealous against evil ones." Don't be jealous of other people. Pettiness is a sign of weakness of character. If you are a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ and you find yourself in some state of pettiness, you are a weak, unstable person.

n emotional revolt or, worse yet, an emotional cripple. Stop being envious against the evil ones. Neither desire to be with them. The evil ones here are people who appear to be prosperous in some way. They appear to have their right man or right woman. They appear to be financially well-off. They appear to be successful in some way. And to envy these people is a sign of pettiness and weakness of character. Verse 2, For their right lobe, minus doctrine, studies destruction. The destruction is reversionism. They study to be reversionist. They work at it.

The lips talk mischief, overt sins of the tongue. Gossip, maligning, judging, put down, and so on. Nitpicking, whatever you want to call it. Verse 3, Through wisdom, the daily function of gap, a house is built. This is the edification complex of the soul. By understanding, one prepares himself. While a believer is constructing the edification complex of the soul, he is also preparing himself for life. And by the time he reaches super grace, he is prepared. This is what happened to David.

In his soul. The house in his soul was the edification complex. And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled. Knowledge is gapping it to the construction of the edification complex. It will be filled with all precious. The word precious is something of value. And pleasant riches, something stimulating. And this brings us to the super grace life. Once the chambers are filled, the edification complex is completed. And the believer is now in super grace, pleasant riches. Verse 5, A wise man, strong. A man of knowledge, that is, knowledge of doctrine.
