# I Have Seen A King - David Lesson 001 

## Failuers of Samuel and Saul
### 1 Samuel 16:1-12
## Psalm 78:70
## 2 Sam 7:8

The Word of God is alive and powerful, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit of the joints and the marrow, and is a critic of thoughts and intents of the heart. All Scripture is God-breathed and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God might be mature, thoroughly furnished unto all good works. Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.

Open the Word of Truth this morning to 1 Samuel 16, verse 1. 

In preparation for our study of the Word of God this morning, the next few moments are devoted to silent prayer. The objective is to give you the privacy of your priesthood in order that you might use the rebound technique if necessary. The ministry of God the Holy Spirit is vital for the intake of the Word of God.

Rebound, mechanically, is described in 1 John 1.9. You simply name your sins, and you're forgiven and cleansed from all unrighteousness. You don't have to feel sorry for them. How you feel about them is totally inconsequential.

But under the principle of the grace of God, you simply name them, and you're forgiven on the basis of the fact that Christ was judged for those sins on the cross. Therefore, in order that we might be prepared for our study of the Word of God this morning, the next few moments are devoted to silent prayer.

Let us pray. (allow a moment for confession)

We thank you, Father, that we have come to the place where we can regard every day alike, where we recognize that every day is a grace gift from thee. We neither earn nor deserve the fact that we are still on this earth for a purpose. And therefore, we thank thee this morning that we have the privilege of feeding upon the Word and taking in this manna from heaven. Now, may God the Holy Spirit enlighten us as we examine these things this morning. For we ask it in Christ's name, amen.

We have been studying lately in various passages of Scripture the principle of the super-grace life. 

And we have seen in the fifth chapter of James, for example, that God has the capacity to give. Not only does he have the capacity to give, but the assets to give.

His character is perfect, and therefore, under perfect character and unlimited assets, God is qualified to give as no one has ever been qualified. But God has a great problem in giving as far as the human race is concerned.

The problem has to do with the fact that those who are members of the family of God, believers, are in a place where God cannot give them the things of this life. He wants them to be happy. That's his objective. In fact, God keeps you around here to be happy.

You may have noticed that since you believed in Jesus Christ, you've had everything but happiness. Well, if that's true, and this particular series is for you, we have seen in the fifth chapter of James, where we have a discussion of monetary reversionism, that God is looking for a man with whom he can entrust a million dollars, a billion dollars.

> God has no limit on what he can give.

However, most believers will never have the capacity for this kind of success in the field of monetary and business activity. The way in which God would provide this is through capacity, and the only way to get capacity is through the super-grace life.

> The limitation is not with God. The limitation is with man's capacity.

Now, since the day that you have believed in Jesus Christ, God had a gracious way of providing capacity for you. This grace way has to do with taking doctrine into the left lobe. Doctrine goes into the left lobe, and through GAP (Grace Aparatus for Perception) is cycled into the human spirit as epinosis.

Then it is cycled up into the heart of the right lobe, into the frame of reference. From the frame of reference, it becomes vocabulary, categories, norms, and standards, and doctrine gets on the launching pad. Now, that's the beginning.

With this <span class="theological-term">Epignosis</span> doctrine, the believer begins to construct a house in the soul, an **edification complex**.

**The Five Floors of the Edification Complex:**

1. **First Floor:** Grace orientation
2. **Second Floor:** Mastery of the details of life
3. **Third Floor:** Relaxed mental attitude of agape love
4. **Fourth Floor:** Capacity for love
   - Category one: toward God
   - Category two: right-man, right-woman
   - Category three: friendship
5. **Fifth Floor:** <span class="theological-term">+H</span> (Happiness)

God wants you to be happy. God wants to share his perfect happiness with you.

His perfect happiness is +H. And while you agree with God that you want to be happy, if you go about it your own way, you will never achieve it. But this is God's way.

And from this +H, the believer moves into super grace. 

Super grace has capacity for freedom, capacity for life, capacity for love, capacity for prosperity, capacity for adversity, many other wonderful things. 

> It is the super grace life where God can express to the maximum his own capacity to give.

For example, there was a man, 1,900 years ago, who reached the super grace life, and in that area he had capacity for doctrine. 

So God entrusted more doctrine with that man than anyone in human history. 

That was the Apostle Paul. He gave him things in the field of doctrine that he was never able to entrust to anyone else.

The same thing is true in other areas. 

However, as far as the record goes, and as far as history goes, probably this church age will not end until God finds at least one man in business, one man who has the capacity to receive from God a maximum amount of money, billions of dollars if necessary, and have happiness.

There are other areas where this has been fulfilled. 

There is one area where we go back to the Old Testament in order to see what super grace capacity can do.

David was a super grace believer. 

As a super grace believer, and having achieved that very early in life, God was able to give him two things that he has never given to anyone else in all of human history. 

Not that these things are not available, but because of lack of taking in doctrine and lack of capacity on the part of individuals, no one has ever achieved it.

David, because of his phenomenal intake of doctrine, succeeded in two great professions. 

David is one of the greatest military leaders who ever lived. 

He was one of the most successful junior officers. He was one of the most successful battalion commanders.

He was one of the most successful commanders who ever lived. 

And David's military record is without parallel when it comes to being successful in every stage of a commissioned officer's life.

He had the capacity for this, and his capacity was so phenomenal that David's conquests of at least five or six other nations led to the greatest expansion that the Jews have ever known in all of their history.

In addition to that, David became the king of Israel. 

And as king, he is still on record throughout both Kings and Chronicles as the greatest king who ever lived. 

> No one ever surpassed David in capacity for rule, capacity for success.

So here is a man who illustrates the principle of capacity for success in two separate professions in one lifetime. 

No one has ever surpassed David in this combination. He stands alone.

He stands alone in the sense that Jeremiah stands alone. Moses stands alone. The apostle Paul stands alone.

But the tragic thing is that in this 20th century and in our generation, there is no excuse for a large number of believers finding this capacity. 

Believers in all walks of life. Women with capacity to love, as it has never been known.

The Christian women of this generation ought to be the greatest lovers and therefore have the greatest happiness in human history. 

Men ought to have capacity for leadership. Capacity for success in their chosen profession. Capacity for military victory. Capacity for wealth. Capacity for happiness.

And it is this very thing that we lack today. And one of the very most obvious reasons we lack it is because some of you are here today because it's a sort of a holiday and you've hooked it up somehow with God.

Now, when people think of Christmas and Easter as a time to come to church, then obviously they have no capacity for life whatever. Being born again does not guarantee you anything except eternal life and perfect happiness in phase three. But you're living in phase two.

And all of God's objectives for your life, for your happiness, for your blessing, for your success, are related to Bible doctrine. And that's why we are not having a special Christmas service.

We have special religious holidays. We are at the point right now where we regard every day alike, where every day is given to us by God, and every day is a point to be redeemed and a day to be happy and a day for blessing.

And therefore, that nonsense we used to have when we were still in certain growing pain stages, such as having a bunch of people give testimonies about how thankful they are, that's all over. 

Why? 

Because if you're any kind of a believer at all, you're thankful every day and you don't have to stand up in front of a bunch of people and tell everyone how you feel.

And this is the way we keep all of the emotional cripples from giving some kind of a testimony so they won't have a guilt complex when they stuff themselves with turkey. 

I remember how people used to go out of here weeping how good it was to have been here, how inspiring testimonies were, and all the rest of that nonsense.

Well, once you get into super grace, you get past all that stuff. 

And if you're not in super grace and you go out of here sort of an emotional hangover or hung up emotionally, then you're in trouble. 

And you better come back tonight and the next night and the next night until you find out at least what the challenge is.

Now, this morning we began a study of a young man who decided to skip all of the fundsville of his day. He wasn't stealing money out of the teacher's drawer. He wasn't even chasing the little girls across the school ground.

He had something else in mind. He had in mind the fact that he could be a young person and not stupid. That he could be a young person and not ruin his entire life because he was stupid.

And therefore, he went all out in his youth for something that carried him through his entire life. Apparently, David lived to be around 80. And he had a ball.

He had aberrations like we all do. And he got into reversionism on a couple of occasions. But David was a person who, in the overall picture, had a most phenomenal happy life.

And when all the other kids were going into town to raise hell on weekends, David was out there with a bunch of stinking, woolly sheep. But it wasn't the sheep that made David great.

And it wasn't the fact that the sheep smelled bad. And sometimes David, too, that made him great. This might have made him unique in certain areas. But not great.

The thing that made David great was the fact that out there with those sheep, he took in Bible doctrine every day. God made it available because this man threw up positive signals.

However, we're not going to start with David and a few stinking sheep. I hope none of you have lamb today.

This passage is, first of all, the story of three men:

Samuel, a mourning prophet, and I don't mean early in the morning. I mean crybaby, a prophet mourning for someone. 

Saul, a reversionistic king. 

And David, a super grace shepherd. 

Three people are found in this passage.

This passage also finds the nation Israel, where the United States of America is today, reversionistic and defeated. A reversionistic nation can only go in one of two ways. It can go out under the fifth cycle of discipline, into slavery. Or it can recover from its reversionism and go on to greater things.

History records both kinds. But we have yet to discover which way we are going.

So don't be thankful today for a welfare state, because a welfare state is a manifestation of reversionism. And never in our history have so many parasites sucked so much freedom from so many people who have been blessed on the basis of establishment.

This is a nation of parasites. This is a nation of yellow-bellied cowards. This is a nation of defeatists. This is a nation that is of bleeding hearts, and crybabies, and guilt complexes, and psychos running things.

This is the worst situation that has ever existed. And it's either going to get worse, which is almost inconceivable at times, or it's going to get dramatically better.

And whichever way it goes, it depends upon you as a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ. If you are a reversionist, then you're going to go down with this nation. But if you are supergrace, then this nation has a chance.

Whether you become supergrace or not depends upon your attitude toward doctrine. No believer will ever be happy in phase two if he stays in reversionism.

Now let's take a look at 1 Samuel 16, verse 1. 

> "And the Lord said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel? fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons."

One verse, and three men are mentioned in one verse.


The <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Amar</span>.

<span class="hebrew">Amar</span> means that a decree in this case. The Lord decreed to Samuel.

Samuel is the first great prophet in Israel since Moses. 

From Moses to Samuel, the problems which accumulated to this nation were fantastic.

And now we have a possibility of some positive volition again in Israel. And therefore, God provides a communicator.

There's a principle here in the word Samuel. 

The principle is this. Whenever a nation has among its believers those who are positive toward doctrine, there's a principle. God will provide.

He will provide communicators of doctrine. And Samuel was such a person.

Samuel was the son of Hannah. He was born about 1080 B.C., a thousand years before Christ. He replaced the reversionistic sons of Eli.

And in effect, Samuel became not only a prophet, but the last of the judges. 

After the disastrous defeat of Israel by the Philistines in 1 Samuel 4, verse 1, Samuel does not appear again in the history of the Bible for 20 years, at which time he assembled together the reversionistic people at Mizpah, where he laid it on the line to them, and they repented of their reversionism.

At this point, Samuel the prophet became the last judge. That was in 1050 B.C.

At the request of the people, Samuel appointed a king over Israel. Now, this was a sign of their failure. 

This was a sign of human viewpoint.

God was doing a great job for the people. He was holding them together and had held them together for 400 years.

And now, instead of letting God do it, they decided they ought to get a man. And obviously, they picked the tallest, the best-looking man they could find.

People are always stupid. They observe outwardly without realizing the character or the soul of the man.

And overtly, King Saul was a very handsome, very attractive, and a very talented person. He had a talent for being clever. He had a talent for winning a few battles through his cleverness.

He had a talent for putting himself over and giving the impression, like so many fundamentalist christians do today, that he was a very humble and a very sweet person. He also did not have true courage.

He did not have that moral courage that goes with doctrine in the soul. And when the chips were down, he always failed.

But the Lord said unto Samuel, "How long wilt thou mourn?"

This is a <span class="hebrew">hithpa'el</span> from the verb <span class="hebrew">aval</span> (A-V-A-L).

Now, <span class="hebrew">aval</span> in the <span class="hebrew">hithpa'el</span> stem is reflexive.

<span class="hebrew">Hithpa'el</span> means, "How long are you going to feel sorry for yourself?"

The principle is of <span class="hebrew">aval</span> in the <span class="hebrew">hithpa'el</span>, that first of all, Samuel began by being concerned for his nation, for he was truly patriotic. 

He had enough Bible doctrine. He had enough understanding of the laws of establishment to realize that his nation was in great jeopardy. 

But he began to think of Saul as the solution.

And therefore, the hithpa'el of aval indicates that he was mourning for himself. 

At this stage, he was feeling sorry for himself.

And the principle is quite obvious. If you become concerned for your nation because you realize its jeopardy, its status quo of falling apart and being destroyed, it is very easy to go from concern for your nation to personal self-pity, unless you are stabilized by Bible doctrine.

It's a very easy stage to go down from concern for your nation to self-pity, concern for yourself. 

And that's exactly what has happened to this great prophet. He himself is in a state of reversionism.

How did it get to the place where he was mourning for Saul? 

Well, there came a day when Samuel went negative toward doctrine.

And when he did, he began to get scar tissue on the left bank of the soul. And that opened up matiotes, and human viewpoint began to come through this vacuum and attacked his right lobe.

First of all, it attacked his categories, and he began to lose track of the categories of doctrine which he applied daily to his life.

And then their language starts to shift. Suddenly, it’s all about “being nice,” “accepting everything,” “never judging,” and “keeping the peace no matter what.” They start saying things like, “We just need to love everyone unconditionally,” “don’t stand up to wrong ideas, just go along to get along,” or “let’s give up a few freedoms for the sake of safety and harmony.” Before you know it, their convictions are gone, replaced by trendy slogans and feel-good phrases that sound compassionate but are really empty. That’s how vocabulary changes — and it reveals how far the soul has drifted.

Then we have norms and standards begin to fall apart.

And no longer does Samuel sees the success of the Thocracy under God but he begins to think as Saul as the only hope, because Saul is tall, he's handsome, he's very personable, he's clever, he's talented. And so the norms and standards change, and therefore the launching pad gets filled with human viewpoint.

Then there is a frantic search for happiness. In Samuel's case, Samuel was a prophet and had a little trend toward asceticism and his old sin nature, so he started by being very legalistic fundamentalist type. He got more legalistic every day in his mourning for Saul.

In addition to that, there was some emotional revolt in his soul, but the great tragedy is the destruction of the edification complex of the soul (ECS). 

Samuel, the prophet, the spiritual leader, is now in a state of reversionism. And in this state of reversionism, he's in trouble. He's mourning for Saul.

Saul, of course, was potentially a great king. 

Again, he's handsome in appearance, he's gifted, he appears to be humble, he had great physical strength, and he also had the ministry of God the Holy Spirit going for him at the beginning of his rule.

He could have been one of the greatest kings in history, but there's many a slip between the potential and the attainment. Just because a person has human potential, it does not mean that he will ever succeed.

> If God doesn't promote you, you're not promoted. 

This is something that King Saul never learned.

All right, let's look then, 1) at the Grace potential of Saul, and 2) the failure of Saul. 

### The grace potential of Saul

1. **He was separated from the rest of Israel by divine appointment.** 1 Samuel 10:1 describes how Saul was anointed king over Israel. He was anointed by divine appointment. The people wanted a ruler so they could be like other nations. They were wrong, but God still permitted him to be appointed. This was his grace potential.

2. **He was encouraged by divine promises.** 1 Samuel 10:6-7

3. **He was changed by grace.** When he first became king, he responded to doctrine. 1 Samuel 10:9, he responded to the point where he has to be classified as a reversionist.

A reversionist is an apostate who once liked Bible doctrine. Like many of you, you used to go for Bible doctrine. You used to come to Bible class every night. Now you're nothing but reversionists, and all reversionists have the same problem. Divine discipline.

When you get into reversionism, you start to practice reverse process reversionism. 

Whereas doctrine used to be the most important thing in your life, you now have other substitutes for doctrine.

Where the Lord Jesus Christ was first in your life, now you go for inconsequential persons. 

You had, for example, a right-woman, you being a right-man, now you go for false women. You are involved with inconsequential persons, and you're socially and sexually unfaithful to your right-woman.

Here again, you have true friends, and instead you're over here fooling around with your false friends, with the other stupid people that are going down with you. That's the problem.

The problem is that grace can change you, but when you reject the source of grace, which is Bible doctrine, you've had it. So, we have the fact that in the grace potential of King Saul, he was changed by grace, 1 Samuel 10:9.

4. **He was assured by his circumstances.** Also 1 Samuel 10:9. His circumstances gave great encouragement.

5. **He was blessed in an unusual way by God** in a time when the Holy Spirit was limited to a few people. He was moved by the Holy Spirit, 1 Samuel 10:10.

6. **He was humbled by his prospects.** 1 Samuel 10:21-22. All of this makes up the grace potential.

Saul was a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, and he had the opportunity of being one of the great kings of all time, of having a very happy and prosperous reign. 

Instead, he's going to have a totally miserable reign. And the reason is because of triple compound divine discipline.

The first area of discipline to a reversionist is called knocking. Behold, I stand at the door and knock, says the Lord Jesus. That is disciplinary warning to the reversionist in his first stages.

The second stage is intensity. We have the knocking stage. That's discipline. Then it gets worse. All discipline intensifies.

Things that would make you happy make you miserable. 

You may have a little success with money. It makes you miserable. You have a little success with women or men, whichever the case may be. It makes you miserable. You have a little social life. It makes you miserable.

Everything is intensified. This is the intensified stage. 

And the final stage is dying. The sin unto death.

You die horribly and miserably. We will see all of these things in our study this weekend. The knocking stage. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. Warning that you're in reversionism.

The intensified stage, when all of the discipline gets worse and worse and worse. And finally, the dying stage.

And there are two areas where you can change your mind. You can go positive and immediately get with doctrine. This is the rebound stage. You can rebound here and turn positive.

Repent means to go from negative over to positive. And you can do this by rebounding and getting back with doctrine.

But, in the intensified stage, you have to repent. And then, as we saw, for example, in James 5, someone, your pastor teacher, has to pray for you. And that gets you rolling back here. And you have to repent in this stage.

So, one is a rebound stage. The other two are repent stages.

Now, Saul is going to go through all of these stages. And Saul is eventually going to die, the sin unto death.

David is going to go up, he goes into super grace, happiness, and success as Saul goes down. 

Not at Saul's expense. Because God gives Saul every opportunity.

God kept Saul alive for 40 more years in order to give him every opportunity. 

And over a period of 40 years, he went from the knocking stage to the intensity stage to the dying stage. 

And eventually, he died miserably.

In the meantime, he will go through every stage of reversionism. He was, at times, psychotic. He was a psychopathic personality.

He suffered from mental attitude reversionism. He suffered from verbal reversionism. He suffered from almost every system of reversionism. He went through every type of discipline.

In other words, Saul is a person who had everything going for him and turned it all down by his neglect of Bible doctrine. 

That is the grace potential of King Saul.

Secondly, let's take a quick look at his failure. 

### The failure of Saul

1. **He died the sin unto death.** 1 Chronicles 10:13-14. The sin unto death is the exception to dying grace. It means to go out horribly and miserably.

2. **He began reversionism by ignoring the Word of God.** 1 Samuel 13:9-14. In that particular passage, he was told to kill the enemy. And there was one enemy, the king, who had a great personality, and he didn't want to kill him. And because he refused to kill the enemy, there he was obviously rejecting the Word of God and obviously got into reversionism.

3. **King Saul ignored the will of God.** 1 Samuel 15:3, 9

4. **Saul's reversionism is summarized** in 1 Samuel 15:22-23

5. **Saul is rejected by the Lord.** 1 Samuel 15:35

Now, when I give you these categorical developments, looking up the verses later and studying them is the basis of blessing. All I can do is analyze and give you something to do.

This brings us back to our passage. 

The Lord said unto Samuel, the man who has been the great communicator of doctrine, the last judge, a prophet, he is now turning over his ruling responsibility and has, to King Saul, but he's still a prophet.

How long will you feel sorry for yourself and for Saul? 

Remember that he, first of all, he started out being concerned for his nation. Then he moved into self-pity in which he feels sorry for, remember that self-pity includes others.

How long, Hithpa'el, Samuel, will you feel sorry for yourself? Samuel has a case of feeling sorry for himself.

But when a person feels sorry for self, he always becomes an emotional cripple. And he begins to feel sorry for others on a totally erroneous basis.

He is feeling sorry for Saul. He is not, he is not compassionate here, but as an emotional cripple, he feels sorry for others who are out of line.

This is like a gangster feeling sorry for a gangster. This is like a rapist feeling sorry for a rapist. This is like a murderer feeling sorry for a murderer.

This is emotional revolt of the soul perpetuated into total reversionism.

What is the divine view of King Saul? 

"I have rejected" the <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> perfect of <span class="hebrew">MAAS</span>.

Now, <span class="hebrew">Maas</span> means that while King Saul is going to reign for a long time yet, God has rejected him as the king, but wants to give him in grace every opportunity to recover from reversionism.

Remember that God is fair. 

And even though this man is now rejected, grace gives him every opportunity to go from negative to positive toward doctrine and to recover.

"I have rejected him from reigning over Israel". And this particular phrase literally means "from being king over Israel".

Now, in addition to that, God's plan moves on. Here's the principle. 

> Reversionism never hinders the plan of God.

If you go into reversionism, God's plan is going on with you or without you. And God's plan is not held up by anyone. Therefore, no one is indispensable in God's plan.

And if you choose reversionism, you lose all chance for happiness in time. And God has something He wants to do on your behalf. God wants to prove to you that He can make you happy in time.

God is going to make you very happy in eternity. You may be the sorriest Christian who ever lived. You may be worse than King Saul as a reversionist. But in eternity, you're going to have perfect happiness like everyone else.

God only has a short time here on this earth to show you how happy He can make you. And His capacity to give under grace is phenomenal.

But what holds Him up? I'll tell you what holds Him up. Lack of capacity for this happiness. Lack of capacity for freedom. Lack of capacity for love. Lack of capacity for life. These are the things that hold everyone up.

So here we have the principle. And it's a very important principle. He is rejected from reigning over Israel, but He is still going to be king for another 30 years or so. And this is the grace opportunity.

God wanted to, in the worst kind of a way, He wanted to bless King Saul. He was most anxious to bless Saul.

And God loves Saul in reversionism, just as God loves you in reversionism. Your spiritual status does not affect God's love for you.

> God loves you on the basis of His character. God loves you on the basis of who and what He is, not on the basis of who and what you are.

You may love people on a meritorious basis. It's pitiful if you do. But God loves on the basis of His own perfect character.

And if true love ever comes to you, it's because Bible doctrine will so improve your soul capacity that you will love people on the basis of who and what you are as a super grace believer.

God kept Saul alive for 30 more years. Why? Because God wanted, in the worst kind of a way, to share in time.

And can't you see Saul when he comes to heaven? And the Lord meets him there and says, Why do you think I kept you alive for 30 more years? Now you have all of this happiness... You could have had it down there.

You've heard of hell on earth. Saul says, Yeah, I had it. You could have had heaven on earth.

And then, of course, enter into the kingdom and all the blessings, and he does. No more sorrow, no more tears, no more pain, no more death. The old things have passed away.

Now, a lot of you always get a little nervous that forever and ever and ever you're going to be a third-class Christian because you were a reversionist in time. Not at all. That's the whole point.

God only has the short time of your lifetime as a believer to demonstrate how great His grace is. He only has that time to give you as much as you are capable of taking in.

You're just like a paper bag. Some of you are a little tiny paper bag. And, therefore, that's about all you can get. And some of you are a larger paper bag. And some of you are a big sack. And some of you... I didn't say you were an old bag, just a big one.

All of you have different capacities.

Your capacity for doctrine is your capacity for life. Put it down. Your capacity for doctrine is your capacity for life.

And your capacity for life determines how much God can give you. 

And God is saying today of the year of our Lord, 1972 A.D., God is saying, Where is someone that I can give a billion dollars? Where is someone I can give a right man or a right woman and that will be the greatest love of the century? Where is someone in a profession I can endow with success?

I want to share my happiness with you in time. I don't want to wait until you come to heaven. It's no contest when you come to heaven. It's automatic. Now's the time I want to show you how I can give you happiness. 

So the issue is a very simple one. Where were you when God was trying to pass out happiness? 

And some of you are going to have to say I was in reversionism. I wasn't there. And that's the tragedy.

"I have rejected him from reigning over Israel". 

> Now get this. The plan of God moves on... 

With or without you, King Saul.

You had everything going for you in grace. Or you thought you had everything going for you in the energy of the flesh. You thought because you had all those muscles. You thought because you were taller than anyone else.

You thought that because you were handsome. You thought that because you were clever that this was the secret to your success. 

But the secret to your success was grace. 

And when you reject grace, listen, what's going to happen to you?

The plan of God is going to go right on. And you're going to be sitting there in the dust of your misery, your self-pity, and your eventual death.

What a tragedy that a man with so much grace potential has to be left behind. But that's nothing.

If you are here this morning and you have personally believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, you have the same grace potential as King Saul. You have everything going for you and more.

You live in the church age. 

You are a priest. 

You are an ambassador for Jesus Christ.

You have permanently what Saul had temporarily, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. 

You have the indwelling of Jesus Christ that Saul did not have. 

You are in union with Christ, positional truth, something that Saul did not possess.

You have things going for you that are phenomenal. 

You have everything in writing.

Saul had to listen to Samuel. He had to go where Samuel was to get the info. You have it before you in the Word of God.

You have everything going for you. And the question that comes up on this Thanksgiving, are you being left behind? Is God knocking on the door?

Now, when you open the door to let him in, that means you repent in reversionism. It has nothing to do with salvation.

God is knocking on the door because you've had some lumps lately. You've had some misery lately. You've had some trouble. And that's a warning to your soul. You're going down in reversionism.

Wake up! Wake up before it hits intensity. When it hits intensity, you won't hear the knocking anymore. You'll be screaming.

You'll be screaming so loud, you won't hear the knocking on the door anymore. And then when you hit the sin unto death, God help you, you're going to be the most miserable person in the world.

And don't call me to come running to your bedside when you're dying or however you die. Because I don't go to bedsides. 

If you have doctrine, you don't need me. If you don't have doctrine, you don't need me.

And I cannot wave a magic wand in five minutes when you have missed every Bible class for five years or whatever it is. 

You say, isn't that a little hard nose? No, that is the issue.

And I am the representative of the Lord Jesus Christ to you. 

And I have no intention of patting you on the head or holding your hand while you are in misery. A misery you have manufactured by your own negative volition toward doctrine.

"I have provided". The <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> perfect of <span class="hebrew">RAAH</span>. Different. It doesn't mean to provide. <span class="hebrew">R-A-A-H</span>. IT means to see.

> I have seen a king.

Now, what did God see?

God saw the soul of David out with the sheep. What would you see? You would see a flock of sheep out in the hills of southern Israel and Judah. You would see a shepherd.

A very handsome, red-headed shepherd, young man. 

He's in his late teens now. Later on, he will be 24 when he is introduced to Israel. He's called already a <span class="hebrew">MELEKH</span>, a King.

And even though he's a long way from the throne, he's at least 30 years from the throne, God said it. That's it. 

I wonder what God said about you 10 years ago? 

I see a billionaire. I see a successful person in medicine, in law, in the military. I see the greatest lovers of the century. What did he say about you? 

Maybe it's not printable.

I, and get this, it's Qal-perfect. The perfect tense is completed action. 

I have seen a king. Isn't this beautiful?

Billions and billions and billions and billions of years ago, God knew every decision David would ever make. God knew that David was one of those kind of people who would gap it daily.

God knew that David would love Bible Doctrine.

I have seen a king. Not I have provided. I have seen a king.

All right, let's see if we can see what God saw. Let's turn to Psalm 78:70.

Psalm 78:70. Now get this. This is something we could see. God can see something that we can see in Psalm 78:70.

He chose David also his servant. David was a super grace believer. He took him from the sheepfolds.

Now, how on earth can anyone ever... You could say to David when he presents himself, he makes application for king. 

What are your qualifications? shepherd 

What experience have you had? taking care of sheep

I don't think David would make it today, do you? I don't think David could even get on the ballot.

David wouldn't make it today because people are stupid. That's why. American people are stupid.

David, the divine viewpoint, the divine viewpoint disappears. 

The ballots of this country have been dignified with some of the most awful reversionists who ever lived.

People who are, if they even came close to running anything in this country, would destroy you. 

Why even allow on a ballot someone who would destroy you? Doesn't make sense.

Well, what are David's qualifications? Here we have it. He chose David also his servant and took him from the sheepfolds.

What on earth would make a person a good king by handling a flock of woolies? 

One. Very simple. First of all, sheep stink. They are the most malodorous of quadrupeds. In other words, they are four-legged animals that have an awful smell.

Well, to hang around sheep, you have to smell like them out of self-defense, or you can't stand it. 

David is going to have a nation of some malodorous people, so I can see his qualifications.

He gets used to running things that smell bad. Why not make him king? The nation smells bad.

Well, let's take another look at it. Sheep are stupid. Well, that qualifies him. If he can handle a flock of sheep, he can handle a flock of stupid people.

Well, there's another basis here. Sheep have to be fed. And sheep, for example, are never able to take care of themselves when it comes to water. They can't smell water.

So you have to lead them to pastures where they can feed. And you also have to lead them to water. They cannot smell water like the goats. And therefore, of course, they can't find water even when they're dying of thirst.

But here's the problem. Sheep have no sense of direction. Sheep don't know where to go. And therefore, they go any old place.

They go right off a ledge. They get under cactus. They wander away. They have absolutely no sense of direction.

Like many of your friends who navigate for you when you're on a trip. They just have no sense of direction. They don't know north from south.

Now, they have to have a shepherd to do the navigating. And when they get out of line, the shepherd knows they're supposed to be going north. And a couple of dumb woolies are going east.

What does he do? He's got that stick. Why? To go out there and whack them on their little tender noses and other tender spots and get them back in line.

They're stupid. And they don't know what's good for them, but the shepherd does. And so, therefore, the shepherd brings them around.

But do you realize that all of these things that I'm saying make a good shepherd, but not necessarily a good king? Although there are some parallels which you can see.

There is one thing David had going for him that made him a great king, the greatest king of all time, and that made him the greatest military man of all time. Of all the great captains in history, David is the greatest.

Now, why? 

> Bible doctrine in the soul. That's what made him great.

Bible doctrine in the soul. When he was out with the sheep, he was alone. He was away from people.

He was away from the problems and the traps of approbation lust and power lust. And he spent his time building the edification complex of his soul and entering into super grace.

He was a prepared man because he was prepared in his soul. No matter how you rationalize the job of a shepherd, the job of a shepherd still doesn't make you king.

This is one of the fallacies that people have. And this is the way the commentaries all like to explain it. There's a direct analogy between being a shepherd of a bunch of dumb sheep and being the king of a bunch of dumb people.

But there isn't. Because dumb sheep walk on four legs and dumb people walk on two legs. And therefore, there's all the difference in the world.

And a man could be a great shepherd and a lousy king. And a man could be a lousy king and a good shepherd.

So it doesn't jive. It doesn't add up. And therefore, if you have a commentary that tries to explain that, get rid of it.

> Because the secret is grace. 

> The secret is super grace. 

> The secret is Bible doctrine in the soul.

When he says, "I have provided me a king," he says, and adding to that, Psalm 78:70, he chose David also his servant. 

His servant means he was faithful in taking in the word and took him from the sheepfolds.

He could have taken him from anywhere. He could have taken him from any kind of a job.

He could have been a hod carrier and been the greatest king in the world because he had doctrine in his soul. He could have been a buck private in the rear ranks and made the greatest king because he had doctrine in his soul.

He could have been taken from jail. He could have been taken from any job anywhere. He could have been taken from a law office. He could have been taken from an operating room. He could have been taken from a chauffeur's job. He could have been taken from anywhere.

The point is, not what he was doing before, but what he had in his soul while he was doing what he was doing.

In other words, it's possible that God will take from this congregation great people to bring this nation back to what it should be. Great people, not because of what you're doing now.

Experience? You're going to school. You're a student, you say. Well, there is nothing you are learning in the classroom that will ever contribute to your greatness. To the contrary, what you are learning in the classroom is sheer idiocy.

But, if you have, while you are a student, you are learning Bible doctrine, God will pick you up and use you.

You may have some kind of a job. You may be cleaning a warehouse. You may be pounding a typewriter. You may be whacking a cash register.

You may be pushing a broom. You may be carrying a gun and guarding the most inconsequential things in the world. Paintings that are so bad that no one, they should give them away.

You may be doing something and people will say, no wonder he became so great. He guarded abstract art. Not at all, you see.

Now, what is this passage really saying? 

That David, but God chose him because he was a shepherd? No.

> God chose him because he was a super grace believer. That's why.

Now, what you are doing, now you get this, Mr. On Your High Horse or Miss High Hat. What you are doing while you get your super grace life doesn't mean a thing.

It means only this. It is enough money to keep body and soul together. It's enough to keep you in hamburgers while you're on your way to super grace.

A lot of people come here from other parts of the country, as you probably know or have heard. And we have a lot of jobs, which obviously these jobs don't carry any super thing.

And so people say, turn up their nose, I wouldn't take that job. That job, you know. I came here for doctrine. I'm special.

If it's a job, I don't care how inconsequential that job is. You take that job and take in doctrine. That's what counts.

And don't stick your snooty nose up in the air and say you're too good to wash dishes or wait on tables or do some horrible, monstrous thing. You're not.

The point is, David was doing a very lousy, stinking, poor, horrible, frustrating job. Taking care of sheep.

But while he was taking care of sheep, he was taking in Bible doctrine every day.

David couldn't even come out with his glowing testimony. I was a cowboy. He wasn't a cowboy. He was a sheep herder.

That's what happened to that pro team up north of us here. They used to call themselves the Dallas Cowboys. Now they're the Irving Sheep Herders.

No matter how you slice it, David doesn't have a testimony. Thank God he doesn't have a testimony.

Why was David great? 

David didn't do a thing except take in doctrine and do his job.

Doctrine made him do a lot of things out there we're going to see later on. 

Doctrine made him go after a lion.

When most of you say, huh, boy, he only took one sheep. Am I lucky? In fact, you might go into town and have a few just to forget how horrible it was to see that lion coming through.

But not David. Uh-uh. David used doctrine. He used doctrine all the time.

You can use doctrine on a dishwashing job. You can use doctrine while you're cleaning floor. You can use doctrine, all right.

But the world is very mixed up about one thing. The greatest people in this world never had any experience in being great before they were great.

You see, what do people emphasize today? What experience have you had for this job?

You want to be a junior executive? What experience have you had? Well, I was with the Boy Scouts, and I always took care of my mother when my father died, and I did this and this and this. You see, that type of thing.

Nuh-uh.

Once for greatness. That's where human viewpoint almost destroys the possibility. That's why we don't have any great people today.

You say, but isn't being the President of the United States great? No. Not unless you are great.

Isn't being the President of a company great? No. Not unless you are great.

Just think. There are people who are Corporation Presidents who have had ten years' experience being a Corporation President, and they're still not great. They're just as dumb as the day they walked in and sat behind that desk.

There are generals who are just as stupid today as when they were a yearling at West Point. There are men who have gone into the White House who are just as stupid today as when they overspent their allowance in Harvard.

> What is the experience for greatness? Bible doctrine in the soul.

And what does that mean? It means God is going to promote you.

And now you listen to this because you're going to... This is the issue of your life.

> If God doesn't promote you, you are not promoted. 

And if you are not promoted, you are going to go through three stages of misery, and that's the rest of your life. And you will die the sin unto death.

Some of you are starting in the military profession. It's an honorable profession.

It's the lowest time in the history of our country to be an ensign in the Navy, to be a second lieutenant in the Army, or the Marine Corps, or to be a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force.

It's the worst time in history. It's the worst time in history to be an enlisted man in any of these services. It's the worst time to go in the geodetic survey. It's the worst time to go into the Coast Guard.

Our services are run by a bunch of imbecilic civilians. And things could not be worse.

And yet, I say to you, with Bible doctrine, it's the best time to go. Our services are at an all-time low. It's the best time in the world to go in. The best.

Now, some of you are going to rock along and live a miserable life and wonder what Christianity is all about. Because no one can be more miserable than a believer going into reversionism.

No one. Absolutely no one.

And some of you are going to rock along. And you're going to be more and more miserable. And you never knew what happened to you.

Some of you have jobs where you're taking in doctrine. If God doesn't promote you, you're not promoted. But you're going to have capacity, and God's going to bless some of you in a most phenomenal way.

Some of you are very discouraged because you don't think you're getting along well in life. You look at your job, and you have a tendency to compare with other people. Or you have a tendency to be embarrassed when people ask you what you do.

Get Bible doctrine and move on! Your life doesn't depend on what idiots think anyway.

Someone says, well, you're just a waitress, but I'm a car hop at the hamburger stand. Everyone has a tendency to get a little snooty about something.

Snobs come in all sizes, shapes, and descriptions. And don't let snobocracy wipe you out.

Because what your job may be is totally inconsequential. It's the content of doctrine in your soul, and that's the only issue.

I have seen a king.

Now, not only do we have this in Psalm 78:70, but look at 2 Samuel 7:8

Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord of the armies, the Lord of the armies is Jesus Christ, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel

If the Lord doesn't promote you, you're not promoted. Notice who did the work. God did the work.

All God needed was a man with capacity. 

To be a receiver of grace, you have to have capacity. 

Your capacity comes from Bible doctrine in the soul.

You know what this verse is saying, in effect? David, you took in doctrine like no one else. You concentrated on doctrine like no one else.

You were a person whose soul was saturated with doctrine. You had an edification complex. You're a super grace believer, so it was very simple.

All I had to do was take you from the sheepfold, and you didn't go through intermediary steps. You just went all the way to ruler over Israel.

Now, please notice something else. When God promotes you, it's permanent. 

Not only is God the only one who can promote you, but when He does promote you, it's permanent.

How long was David ruler over Israel?

for 40 years and until the day he died. That's how long. When God gives you something, it's permanent.

You go hustling after someone and say, this is my right man, this is my right woman. You don't know from Adam's off ox, much less Adam's rib. So, you may just get too pushy and wind up with a miserable life.

But, when God provides your right man or your right woman, 40 years, till the day you die. It'll be permanent and wonderful, and it'll be happiness and blessing, and not a battle royal every other day, every hour on the hour.

If God doesn't promote you, you're not promoted. And you don't have to worry about God promoting you. You don't even have to get some experience.

You don't have to run out and witness to 10 people right after class. That's what they call experience. That's what they do at seminaries now.

The day that I was in Dallas Seminary, when I heard that they were going to give practical experience. Who wants practical experience? You know what I've had? Since I graduated from seminary, I've had 22 years of practical experience. And I could never have gotten this in seminary.

And this professor gets up, and you know what he says? He says, now, if you're going to really be a good pastor, you've got to go out and pass out tracts on the street corner. Can you see me downtown in Dallas?

Now, I want to tell you something. I would rather die than pass out a tract on a street corner. Do you think that passing out tracts on a street corner would make a preacher out of me?

Just think, I could give my glowing testimony this morning. I remember those days in Dallas when I passed out tracts on the street corner. It's ridiculous. It's stupid.

I went to Dallas Seminary to get theology, to get more of the languages, not to get practical experience. You see, even in Dallas Seminary, they think in terms of human viewpoint. Everywhere you go, it's how much experience have you had.

But it says witness, yes. But God will provide the hearers at the right time when you have enough sense, not to muddy up the waters.

See, all of you get mixed up on experience, experience. What we need to do, people say, is get away from doctrine and have some experiences.

If you get away from doctrine, the only experience you can have is reversionism. And you can be quite a worker on the way down to the sin unto death.

You can witness for Christ, you can pray, you can hustle around a church, you can do all of those things while you're on your way to the sin unto death. What you need is doctrine in the soul.

God sees souls, not overt experience. 

> I have seen a king.

Now let's go back to our passage. Next, we want to notice the failure of Samuel.

In verse 1, Samuel had his eyes on man. He's in reversionism at the time. In mourning for Saul, Samuel had adopted the human viewpoint of life.

The divine viewpoint is that Saul is rejected because of reversionism. The human viewpoint is Saul is a personable king. Saul is clever. Saul is nice looking.

Samuel had his eyes on circumstances. In verse 2, he was intimidated by human viewpoint. Notice verse 2 of 1 Samuel 16.

And Samuel said, "How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me." The <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> Perfect of <span class="hebrew">Harag</span> (H-A-R-A-G).

Now, <span class="hebrew">Harag</span> means to kill in a violent, cruel, vicious way. It doesn't mean to give you the coup de grace and you just fall into unconsciousness. It means to kill you Apache style, slowly, amidst your screams of agony and pain. That's what <span class="hebrew">Harag</span> means.

But notice that <span class="hebrew">Harag</span> is also in the <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> Perfect. And Samuel, in reversionism, has such a good imagination that in his own mind, he's already dead the minute he takes one step toward Bethlehem.

You see how the soul is always the issue? Even in reversionism. Here is Samuel who was afraid of nothing, and now he's afraid of a king in reversionism. He will kill me in great violence.

### The failure of Samuel. 

He had human viewpoint. He chose the wrong man. Verses 6 and 7.

Skip down now to verses 6 and 7. He finally was persuaded by the Lord to go. So he goes to Bethlehem.

1 Samuel 16:6-7 
And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the Lord's anointed is before him. 
But the Lord said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.

And in verse 6, it came to pass, <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> Imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Ha-Yah</span>, when they were come, he looked on Eliab. See, Jesse had to haul his sons in.

Now you remember this bird Eliab. Eliab, he kept looking at him. The <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> Imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Ra-Ah</span>.

Remember the <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> Imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Ra-Ah</span> in verse 1? "I have seen a king." Now we have the <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> Imperfect, which means that Samuel kept looking at this bird Eliab.

Kept looking at why? He was very handsome. Striking in his appearance. And he also was wearing the... He had just gotten out of military school. He was wearing the uniform of a new second lieutenant in the Jewish army. He made quite an appearance.

Very handsome. Very fine looking. Very nice looking young lad.

And Samuel is really taken with this guy. He's looking at him from the outward appearance.

Now we know something about Samuel. Samuel has it in his soul, in reversionism, that whoever the king of Israel is, he must be nice looking. And it's not necessarily an erroneous idea, but in reversionism it's a bad idea.

And therefore, the first nice looking young man he sees, he says, this is the one that I must anoint. All right, so he looked, he kept looking, human viewpoint, on Eliab.

And he said, surely the Lord's anointed is facing him, literally. Now, this presentation occurred about 1013 B.C.

And Eliab was very personable, very handsome, very attractive. But, you see, what Samuel cannot do is to look in the soul of Eliab.

Eliab is a petty type of reversionist. Eliab is a very mediocre, petty person.

Eliab has a younger brother named David. He's not even present at this moment.

David is plus doctrine all the way to super grace. Eliab and the brothers who are living at home are all minus doctrine. They are reversionists.

And yet, Eliab and his older brothers had every opportunity for doctrine as David. They all had the same chance. They lived in the same household.

How is it possible to have all children in the same house, to have some succeed and some fail? Here is a child who is mediocre. Here is a child who is petty.

Here is a child who is full of mental attitude sins and who also has a sharp, vitriolic tongue, which comes from an implacable soul. And yet, in contrast to him, we have a younger brother who is great.

The difference is in the soul. For this is what we have in verse 7.

But the Lord said to Samuel, he decreed to Samuel, <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> imperfect of <span class="hebrew">Amar</span> (A-M-A-R). The Lord decreed to Samuel, "Look not" the <span class="hebrew">hiphil</span> imperfect from <span class="hebrew">Nabat</span> (N-A-B-A-T).

Now, the <span class="hebrew">hiphil</span> stem is causative, active voice. And <span class="hebrew">Nabat</span> in the <span class="hebrew">hiphil</span> really means, "Do not regard with respect." Also has the negative with it.

Do not be caused to regard him with respect. You're looking at him from the overt standpoint, 

> Principle: You can never truly respect a person till you understand something of their soul. You cannot respect, don't ever respect people on the basis of overt appearance.

It's nice, but it is not the basis of respect. You can appreciate beauty in others, but respect must come from the soul of that person.

And that's where 90% of you have gotten off track at some time in your life. That's why I always loved the Apostle Paul.

He was an ugly person. He was so ugly, he was repulsive. He was short and fat and bald and had a big, fat, hooked nose, a big, rumen nose. He had a squeaky voice. 

I'm glad he did. He had more doctrine in his soul than anyone ever lived.

Thank God that the ugliest person that ever came down the pipe had all that doctrine. Because that draws the line very clearly.

Now, there's nothing wrong with looking nice. I don't want some of you to quit brushing your hair. Some of you can cut it, but don't brush it. Don't stop brushing it.

You don't neglect your appearance. But the point is, the content of your soul determines what you are really like.

And no one deserves respect from anyone else until you know something of their soul. And you learn that through conversation. You learn that through being around them.

The eyes are not the window to the soul. A good gambler can fake you into the streets with his eyes.

The mouth is the window to the soul. And what a person's really like? Well, all the words that person ever utters are formed in their soul. And that is the real key.

Now, here is a man who makes a fantastic appearance. But the Lord said to Samuel, Do not have respect for his face. Or on the height of his stature. He's tall.

Because I have refused him. The <span class="hebrew">Qal</span> perfect of <span class="hebrew">MAAS</span> again (M-A-A-S) and this is perfect tense, which means it is permanent. "I have refused him". Third masculine singular suffix refers to Eliab.

And you will see later on why he was rejected. And he is rejected. He has... And how is he rejected? On the basis of his soul. Not on the basis of his appearance. Not on the basis of his muscles.

"I have refused him". Why? For the Lord sees not as man seeth.

And again we have the Qal imperfect of RAAH. 

In verse 1 we had RAAH for the first time. It's mistranslated in verse 1. You have, I have provided. And it's literally, I have seen.

Now we have RAAH again. "He sees not as man sees", for man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord RAAH, the beautiful eyes?  the excellent physique? Not at all: The heart, Hebrew, levh, L-E-V-H. And the heart is the right lobe of the soul. That is the place where all doctrine must reside.

The heart includes: the memory center and the frame of reference. The vocabulary and categories. The norms and standards and the launching pad. That's what the Lord sees.

Bible doctrine in the right lobe. The Lord looks on, or literally, the Lord sees, Qal imperfect, keeps seeing the right lobe.

## Summary

1. **Doctrine in the right lobe is the issue of happiness and grace blessing.** Not experience, not appearance, not some cleverness whereby you can con people into thinking you are something.

2. **Doctrine in the soul is the basis of divine promotion and protection from divine discipline.**

3. **David was God's man.** This anticipates the rest of the chapter. Not because of his experience as a shepherd, but because of Bible doctrine in his soul. That's why Psalm 23 is so important. Psalm 23 reflects doctrine in his soul. Now, there were hundreds and even thousands of shepherds in Israel. How many of them could write Psalm 23? One person, David, is the only one who could write the 23rd Psalm because he's the only one who had the doctrine to do it. Any idiot can quote Psalm 23, but to have the doctrine to write Psalm 23, there was one person. David was God's man. And no matter, even when David fails, David's failures will not keep him from promotion. And listen, do you know that Saul didn't do half of the bad things that David did as a king? And yet Saul wound up under the sin unto death, and David wound up being the greatest king of all time. What does that tell you? Live it up? No, that's what some of the stupid will get out of it. It tells you this, that doctrine in the soul is more important than anything else in life. It's doctrine in the soul that counts. It's feeding on the Word.

4. **Among the sheep, David learned doctrine and had doctrine tested.** But being a shepherd didn't make him great.

5. **David was a grace product all the way.** Therefore, no matter how great David became, only God could take the credit.

No matter how great David became as a warrior, as a battalion commander. In chapter 18, David's a battalion commander. By the time you get to the end of the book, David is a general. By the time you get into the next book, David is a king.

But no matter how great David becomes, only God can take the credit. Listen, you can get nervous if you ever become successful in something and people begin to think you've done something. Then you can get a little nervous. You can get a twitch or two in your right shoulder blade.

> Only God could take the credit. 

There's no way David could take the credit. There was no way he ever tried. That's the beauty of his greatness.

We're talking about a man who's the greatest king who ever lived. We're talking about one of the greatest captains in history. We're talking about a man who succeeded in the best profession there is, the most honorable, the military profession.

We're talking about a man who succeeded as a king. Here is a man who combined a rare system. He succeeded as a soldier and as a civilian. Now that is really something.

He was the greatest civilian of his day, he was the greatest soldier of his day.

He's a grace product all the way. Therefore, only God could take the credit. I refer you again to Psalm 78:70, 2 Samuel 7:8, and also 1 Chronicles 17:7.

6. **David passed the test of super grace without human admiration or approbation.** 1 Samuel 17:34-36. When a lion came and took a lamb, there wasn't anyone standing around cheering David, go out and fight the lion. Go, David, go. Go, David, go. Go, David, go. There wasn't any of that kind of stuff. And after he had killed a lion without a 375 H&H magnum, he still didn't haul this thing in to the nearest bar, throw them down in the middle of the bar, and say, Hey, the drinks are on me. I just killed a lion. Pitiful, isn't it? The way people always try to cash in on their little successes along the way. You know that David didn't even call a press conference? He never called a press conference? No wonder he was great.

7. **When David passed the lion and the bear test through super grace living, he was ready for anything in life, and the giant was as good as dead.**

Meet the super grace hero. And at the time this was said in verse 11, that's what he was. Verse 11.

And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

And Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all thy children? See, Samuel went up and down the line of seven boys.

And he said, There remaineth yet the youngest. And behold, get this. I didn't call him in. You could see him holding his nose. He keepeth the sheep.

Qal active participle of Raah. R-A-A-H. This verb, he keepeth the sheep, means he is shepherding.

And the same Raah is used by David. David could have said, Hey, you're wrong, Dad. The Lord is my shepherd. The Lord is my Raah. Same word in Psalm 23, verse 1.

He keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said to Jesse, Send and fetch him. That means bring him. For we will not sit down till he comes.

And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the Lord said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

And he sent and brought him. He was ruddy. It's an adjective. Admoni. Looks like this. A-D-M-O-N-I. Means red-headed.

I don't know if you ever realize, you may think of Jews as only having dark hair, brown hair. But here is a red-headed Jew. And that isn't all.

He had red hair with beautiful eyes. David had unusually beautiful eyes. He was not a beautiful man. He was a handsome man. But his eyes were beautiful.

And it says, goodly to look to, which means good-looking. "Tobh roi". Good-looking. Handsome. T-O-B-H-R-O-I. Tobh roi. Handsome.

And as the passage then develops it, in verse 12, And the Lord said, Get up, anoint him, this is he.

The word for anoint is a Qal-imperative, mashach. M-A-S-H-A-C-H. And this particular word means to commission. Give him his commission. This is where we get Mashiach or Messiah.

All right. This then brings us down to the end of our introduction and prepares the way for the Bible conference.
